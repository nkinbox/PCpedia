<div style="position:absolute;top:2472;left:12"><nobr>I<font color="#000000" style="font-size:16px">live in Imphal, Manipur. My house, a government quarter in Langol Games Village, is only a couple</font></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:2516;left:12"><nobr>of hours from Kangathei village, which is where I grew up. But when I think about it, I see what a long,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2539;left:12"><nobr>long journey it has been for me, for all of us, from Kangathei to Imphal.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2562;left:37"><nobr>There are policemen standing outside the campus. They have big guns. Itâ€™s a common sight every-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2586;left:12"><nobr>where in Manipur. Both the policemen and the army men.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2609;left:37"><nobr>Past them and through the tall gate is my home. As you enter, youâ€™ll see that the walls of my living</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2633;left:12"><nobr>room are full of framed photographs, photos that mark the milestones in my boxing career.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2656;left:37"><nobr>I never tire of them. In fact, every so often, I stop to look at them because I am never sure if all this</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2679;left:12"><nobr>is real â€“ the Arjuna Award, the Padma Shri. Did I really get them? Here I am, standing next to Pres-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2703;left:12"><nobr>ident A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. There, the next president, Pratibha Devisingh Patil, is handing me the Rajiv</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2726;left:12"><nobr>Gandhi Khel Ratna award. Thereâ€™s a photograph of me with two former sports ministers, Uma Bharati</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2750;left:12"><nobr>and M.S. Gill. So many others. Photographs of me with people whom I couldnâ€™t have met â€“ or did I?</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2773;left:37"><nobr>These visual reminders root me to the present. They tell me that I will not wake up the next morning</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2796;left:12"><nobr>to find myself back in Kangathei, my family and I getting ready for another day of grinding labour in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2820;left:12"><nobr>the fields.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2843;left:37"><nobr>As soon as I walk into the house, my twin sons come charging at me and right into my arms. They</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2867;left:12"><nobr>are quite a handful, always up to some mischief, and they are the centre of my life. Now, there is my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2890;left:12"><nobr>third son. Yet another focus for my being. Onler â€“ husband, friend, partner â€“ smiles at this all-too-fa-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2913;left:12"><nobr>miliar scene.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2937;left:37"><nobr>My family: the surest reminder that I am here, that none of this is a dream.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2960;left:37"><nobr>My years of relentless labour, hard work, the refusal to give up, pushing every boundary I en-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2984;left:12"><nobr>countered. The thrill, the joy of fighting and winning, all my successes. Boxing, the sport I gave myself</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3007;left:12"><nobr>to. And the bronze medal from the 2012 London Olympics, my most prized possession. It is all real. All</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3030;left:12"><nobr>of it. I was the David who took on the Goliaths in the boxing ring â€“ and I won, most of the time.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3054;left:37"><nobr>I thank God for making all of this possible.</nobr></div>

<font size="3" face="Times"><span style="font-size:16px;font-family:Times">
<div style="position:absolute;top:3710;left:12"><nobr>have been any different. At least in hindsight. Not at all. Because I realize that the hardships I faced</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3733;left:12"><nobr>in my formative years are the foundation of my strength. I am tough because of my background. They</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3757;left:12"><nobr>made me who I am today. They gave me the strength to keep fighting. Indeed, they made me want to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3780;left:12"><nobr>fight in the first place.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3804;left:37"><nobr>I was born on 24 November 1982 in a village called Sagang in Manipurâ€™s Churachandpur district.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3827;left:12"><nobr>Sagang is one of the biggest Kom villages, with more than a hundred families living there. I have no</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3850;left:12"><nobr>memory of the place, of course, because my family moved out when I was only five months old. Apa</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3874;left:12"><nobr>told me the story of why we left the village of our ancestors. It was also the story of why he became a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3897;left:12"><nobr>landless farmer, despite being the descendant of a village chief.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3921;left:37"><nobr>His grandfather, my great grandfather, Khumneitong Mangte, was the chief of Sagang Khopui vil-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3944;left:12"><nobr>lage. He was one of the greatest chiefs of his time. During the reign of Maharaj Churachand, he received</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3967;left:12"><nobr>a â€˜red shawlâ€™, presented only to chiefs who had earned the favour of the kings. To commemorate this</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3991;left:12"><nobr>event, Chief Mangte named his grandson, my father, â€˜Pontinkhupâ€™ (â€˜ponâ€™ means cloth in the Kom lan-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4014;left:12"><nobr>guage).</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4038;left:37"><nobr>My father â€“ his official name is Mangte Tonpa Kom â€“ was born to Lerpu and Tonpi. My grandfather</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4061;left:12"><nobr>Lerpu, like his father, was a powerful and famed hunter. Itâ€™s a skill he passed on to my father as well,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4084;left:12"><nobr>who used to hunt for our food when I was a young child.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4108;left:37"><nobr>My grandfather, however, didnâ€™t become the next chief of the village. He was barely educated, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4131;left:12"><nobr>felt that a more learned and capable person ought to be the chief of such a big village. The times were</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4155;left:12"><nobr>changing, he said. So the chiefâ€™s position passed to Singkhuplien Serto, who is the chief of Sagang to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4178;left:12"><nobr>date. Grandfather was a farmer like everyone else in our village. He sent his son to a local Manipuri-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4201;left:12"><nobr>medium school, but Apa soon stopped going to school so he could help his parents at home and on the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4225;left:12"><nobr>farm. Life wasnâ€™t easy, finances even less so, and education was not going to put food on the table.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4248;left:37"><nobr>Apa had three brothers and two sisters. Over the years, as land was divided among the sons, sibling</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4272;left:12"><nobr>rivalries became sharper. The sons were careless in their tending of the land. The monsoons were ir-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4295;left:12"><nobr>regular. Our family fell on hard times. The small farm my grandfather owned was not enough to feed</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4318;left:12"><nobr>his large family. Eventually, in 1971, Grandfather sent Apa off to the house of the chief of Kangathei,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4342;left:12"><nobr>Moirang Akhup, to work as a farmhand. He was known to be one of the wealthiest men in the region</nobr></div>
</span></font>

<div style="position:absolute;top:4427;left:0"><hr><table border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="eeeeee" align="right"><font face="arial,sans-serif"><a name="6"><b>Page 6</b></a></font></td></tr></tbody></table></div><font size="3" face="Times"><span style="font-size:16px;font-family:Times">
<div style="position:absolute;top:4454;left:16"><nobr>and owned a lot of land. He always needed extra hands to help with the work. Chief Akhupâ€™s friends</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4478;left:16"><nobr>recommended Apa, who was young and was known to be honest, strong and hardworking.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4501;left:41"><nobr>And thatâ€™s how my father began his life in Kangathei. He stayed in that village for more than ten</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4524;left:16"><nobr>years, working in the fields and doing any other chores that were asked of him. For my grandparents,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4548;left:16"><nobr>it was one less mouth to feed, and it also meant constant help in terms of cash and rice, which the chief</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4571;left:16"><nobr>sent to their home.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4595;left:41"><nobr>So, although Apa was supposed to return home in two years, his stay at Akhupâ€™s was extended time</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4618;left:16"><nobr>and again. At a very young age, he learnt to fend for himself â€“ a toughness I see in him to this day.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4641;left:16"><nobr>Apa also decided that he would not marry because he didnâ€™t want to bring a wife and children into his</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4665;left:16"><nobr>world of abject poverty.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4688;left:41"><nobr>But God had other plans. On one of Fatherâ€™s rare visits home, grandfather, now old and ailing,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4712;left:16"><nobr>asked him, â€˜When will I get to see my grandchild?â€™ Father wondered about the question and the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4735;left:16"><nobr>oddness of it â€“ after all, grandfather was not starved of the sight of grandchildren. All his sons â€“ except</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4758;left:16"><nobr>Apa and his youngest brother, Atorsing, still a child â€“ were all married and had children. But the hap-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4782;left:16"><nobr>piness of many children does not erase a parentâ€™s worry for any one child. Father did not want to dis-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4805;left:16"><nobr>appoint his parents, and reconsidered the issue of marriage.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4829;left:41"><nobr>He had known my mother, Akham, in Kangathei for several years and felt that she would be a good</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4852;left:16"><nobr>match for him. They got married in 1981. Apa left Kangathei, and returned to Sagang and to his fam-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4875;left:16"><nobr>ily.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4899;left:41"><nobr>Apa was an uneducated, landless labourer who found it hard to make ends meet. But in the midst</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4922;left:16"><nobr>of the struggle, in the ramshackle hut my parents lived in, I was born. Apa tells me that he was filled</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4946;left:16"><nobr>with happiness â€“ both because he was holding his daughter and because he was able to fulfil Grand-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4969;left:16"><nobr>fatherâ€™s wishes. Anu, on the other hand, was disappointed. Like most expecting mothers in India, she</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4992;left:16"><nobr>had hoped for a son. A daughter, she believed, would be more of a burden than a help. Would she</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5016;left:16"><nobr>be able to toil in the fields alongside her father as a son would? The disappointment was short-lived</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5039;left:16"><nobr>though, because she was soon wrapped in gratitude that her child was healthy, and in the happiness</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5063;left:16"><nobr>that she was now a mother.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5086;left:41"><nobr>The tradition in my tribe is to name the children after their elders. As a sign of respect to his</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5109;left:16"><nobr>mother-in-law, Apa chose to name me after her. So the first bit of my name would be â€˜Chungâ€™, after my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5133;left:16"><nobr>grandmother Chungthem. I was named â€˜Chungneijangâ€™ â€“ chung (high), nei (wealthy) and jang (agile).</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5156;left:16"><nobr>A prophetic name, or maybe just a name given by parents who had big hopes of their first child. The</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5180;left:16"><nobr>grandmother who christened me is still alive, although sheâ€™s almost a hundred years old now â€“ we</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5203;left:16"><nobr>canâ€™t be really sure of that, of course, because there were no written records in her day. She hardly</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5226;left:16"><nobr>recognizes me when I visit her these days. I give her money when I visit, and she holds it firmly, while</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5250;left:16"><nobr>asking for her favourite food items instead. She puts the money away because she wants to save it for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5273;left:16"><nobr>her tombstone. I assure her each time that I will take care of that when the time comes. Every time I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5297;left:16"><nobr>visit her, I notice that her memory has faded a little more.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5320;left:41"><nobr>A word here about Anu and her family. Unlike my father, Anu is big-built and tall. People who</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5343;left:16"><nobr>meet her tell me, â€˜Mary, if only you were like your mom, you could have been a better boxer.â€™ Given</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5367;left:16"><nobr>my struggles with shifting to a higher weight category, I do sometimes feel it may have been easier for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5390;left:16"><nobr>me if I were taller. But then again, I know now that experience matters more than height or weight.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5414;left:41"><nobr>Anuâ€™s parents were called Thangpu Leivon and, as I said, Chungthem. She was named</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5437;left:16"><nobr>â€˜Saneikhamâ€™, but is usually called just â€˜Akhamâ€™. Anu is one of seven children. Although my maternal</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:5517;left:16"><nobr>grandparents were slightly better off than my fatherâ€™s family, they werenâ€™t rich, and could never help</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:5564;left:41"><nobr>To return to the story of my birth, it was a time when my parents had nothing to call their own. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5587;left:16"><nobr>was Apaâ€™s only proud possession. He called me â€˜sanahenâ€™, my eldest precious one. Thatâ€™s the endear-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5611;left:16"><nobr>ment he uses to address me to this day.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5634;left:41"><nobr>As the family grew, so did the expenses, and this led to frequent feuds among the brothers. The</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5658;left:16"><nobr>atmosphere at home became increasingly unpleasant. Apa claimed his birthright â€“ his share of grand-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5681;left:16"><nobr>fatherâ€™s farmland. But the division of a small paddy field into four parts was far too painful a decision</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5704;left:16"><nobr>for grandfather to make. Instead, he told Apa:</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5740;left:65"><nobr><i>Tonpa, cham mak jo roh,</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5764;left:65"><nobr><i>Inreng kho in ada lhon jo che</i></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:5823;left:65"><nobr>Tonpa, be anxious no more</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5847;left:65"><nobr>Hard times have abandoned you</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5870;left:65"><nobr>Good times lie in wait for you.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5906;left:41"><nobr>Of what use are words predicting good fortune to a man who has a wife and a baby to feed? Father</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5929;left:16"><nobr>considered other ways to earn a living; perhaps he could be a rickshaw driver in Imphal. But this would</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5953;left:16"><nobr>involve leaving us behind and living separately, which wasnâ€™t something he wanted to do if he could</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5976;left:16"><nobr>help it. Disappointed as he was at not getting his share of the land, Father decided to move back to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6000;left:16"><nobr>Kangathei and leave Sagang forever. If he must live the life of a landless labourer, there was less ig-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6023;left:16"><nobr>nominy in doing so away from his village. And Kangathei was the place he had spent his youth in.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6046;left:16"><nobr>He had friends and well-wishers there. Above all, he could eke out a living without having to separate</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6070;left:16"><nobr>from his wife and daughter.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6093;left:41"><nobr>At Kangathei, we began from scratch. The village chief had given Apa land to build his own house.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6117;left:16"><nobr>A thatched bamboo hut plastered with mud is a creation of skill and hard work â€“ both of which my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6140;left:16"><nobr>father had in abundance. It was in that house Apa built that I spent my childhood, learnt to handle</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6163;left:16"><nobr>household chores and began my education. It was there that my siblings, my sister Singlenei and broth-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6187;left:16"><nobr>er Khupreng, were born soon after. It was there that my parentsâ€™ struggle began in real earnest.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6210;left:41"><nobr>True to his word, except for the occasional family gathering, my father never returned. Grandfather</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6234;left:16"><nobr>has since passed away. I wish he were alive to remind Apa of his prophetic words.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:6899;left:12"><nobr>from Moirang, which is the nearest town. Moirang is significant for many reasons. Itâ€™s close to the fam-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6922;left:12"><nobr>ous Loktak lake; it is a place of stories and folk tales and of much local history; it is where the Meiteis</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6946;left:12"><nobr>celebrate their famous Lai Haroaba festival; it is a meeting place for all the Koms from the neighbouring</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6969;left:12"><nobr>villages. It is where people gather to sell their vegetables and other produce, and where they go to buy</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6993;left:12"><nobr>household necessities. For all of these reasons, it is the place where people from different communities</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7016;left:12"><nobr>can meet and connect. They speak to each other in a dialect of Manipuri known as â€˜Meiteilonâ€™, which</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7039;left:12"><nobr>is why the tribal communities around Moirang are able to speak Manipuri (the language of the Meitei</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7063;left:12"><nobr>plains people) fluently â€“ even if it is with an accent typical of the hill tribes.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7086;left:37"><nobr>Kangathei itself is a small village in the plains, surrounded by a vast expanse of rice fields. The road</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7110;left:12"><nobr>that leads to the village has been named Dr Kalam Road by the locals in honour of the then presidentâ€™s</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7133;left:12"><nobr>visit to Bunglon village (which it is also connected to) in 2006. Sadly, the road is in a state of utter dis-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7156;left:12"><nobr>repair now. But then again, most roads in Imphal are in a deplorable condition. They are riddled with</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7180;left:12"><nobr>potholes and, especially during the rainy season, there is frequent flooding due to clogged drains.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7203;left:37"><nobr>There is another marker to help the reader place my village, but itâ€™s a tragic one: it was the site</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7227;left:12"><nobr>of the Indian Airlines Boeing crash on 16 August 1991. The flight was coming in from Calcutta and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7250;left:12"><nobr>veered into the nearby Thangjing Ching mountain range due to bad weather. Not one passenger sur-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7273;left:12"><nobr>vived. Kangathei was the base camp for the rescue operations that followed. Many locals, including my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7297;left:12"><nobr>father, were hired to recover the bodies. To this day, the people of the area tell stories of the crash â€“</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7320;left:12"><nobr>embellished with ever wilder exaggerations as the years pass.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7344;left:37"><nobr>I was very young back then but I remember many people and many vehicles arriving. I remember</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7367;left:12"><nobr>that it rained, which was frustrating for the rescue workers. My father tells me that soon after the crash,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7390;left:12"><nobr>the plane had been taken apart, and nothing was left behind, except the engine, which was probably</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7414;left:12"><nobr>too heavy to carry. There are many villages in the vicinity of the crash, and people frequent the hills to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7437;left:12"><nobr>collect firewood and bamboo shoot and to hunt. They must have collected and sold the remnants of the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7461;left:12"><nobr>airplane as scrap. I am told that the villagers made some very fine pots with that metal. Although I was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7484;left:12"><nobr>only nine years old then, I remember that it happened on a Sunday, right after the church service. We</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7507;left:12"><nobr>heard a loud noise, and in no time, the village was full of policemen and other high officials. This was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7531;left:12"><nobr>the first time I saw an aeroplane. I still remember with horror the sight of the bodies that were brought</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7554;left:12"><nobr>up close and kept in my village.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:7643;left:41"><nobr>There were maybe twenty to twenty-five households in Kangathei. It was not a wealthy village.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7667;left:16"><nobr>Because so few people had the opportunity to pursue higher education, hardly anyone worked in gov-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7690;left:16"><nobr>ernment departments. Anyone holding a government job, whatever the post, was held in high esteem.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7713;left:16"><nobr>Most people in the village were farmers. Those with large paddy fields were considered rich. Landless</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7737;left:16"><nobr>farmers, like my father, had to work from morning to night just to feed their families. I remember that,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7760;left:16"><nobr>after a whole day of hard work, like digging trenches, Apa earned just enough to buy rice for one day.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7784;left:16"><nobr>When he could, he leased farms and cultivated rice. As a child, he had learnt how to hunt, fish and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7807;left:16"><nobr>grow vegetables. When we had no money to buy rice, he would hunt and fish, and sell the fish to buy</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7830;left:16"><nobr>rice.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7854;left:41"><nobr>Rice is our staple food. Life in the village revolved around rice. The cycle begins in May to allow</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7877;left:16"><nobr>plantation in June or July and harvest in October or November. To be able to store rice for a whole year</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7901;left:16"><nobr>â€“ that is every farmerâ€™s dream. During a good year, farmers manage to save enough for the year and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7924;left:16"><nobr>end up with a little extra, which can be sold to pay for the childrenâ€™s education or for other household</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7947;left:16"><nobr>requirements. Every village celebrates a good harvest with a festival. From ancient times to this day,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7971;left:16"><nobr>that hasnâ€™t changed.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7994;left:41"><nobr>To return to my own family; we were not one of the lucky ones with a yearâ€™s stock of paddy and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8018;left:16"><nobr>firewood. We had no farmland. And my parents had only a rudimentary education, that too in the local</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8041;left:16"><nobr>language. Convinced that his lack of education was at least partly to blame for his lot, Apa was de-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8064;left:16"><nobr>termined that his children must go to an â€˜English schoolâ€™ and complete their matriculation. It was, of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8088;left:16"><nobr>course, a dream way beyond his means: admission fees, monthly fees, textbooks, uniforms, the ex-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8111;left:16"><nobr>penses were many. Still, it was something he was determined to provide for his children.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8135;left:41"><nobr>In the village, children go to school only when they are old enough to look after themselves, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8158;left:16"><nobr>thatâ€™s at about six or seven years of age. In fact, they are by then old enough to look after others as well</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8181;left:16"><nobr>â€“ the sight of a seven-year-old carrying a sibling on her back while her mother is busy with her work</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8205;left:16"><nobr>is not an unusual one. On the whole, kids have a lot of freedom in our society. They play in the open</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8228;left:16"><nobr>fields and wander around, and as long as they come home for meals, parents are not overly worried.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8252;left:16"><nobr>My own childhood was a lot like that.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8275;left:41"><nobr>My first school was the Loktak Christian Model High School, run by a Presbyterian mission in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8298;left:16"><nobr>Moirang. It was one of the townâ€™s best schools. My father had kept small sums of money aside from</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8322;left:16"><nobr>his meagre earnings so he could enrol me in a good school. And I remember how proud he was when</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8345;left:16"><nobr>he secured admission for me there.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8369;left:41"><nobr>In the Kom society of those days, boys were given preference when it came to education. Most</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8392;left:16"><nobr>people believed that, since a girl would get married and go away to her husbandâ€™s home, there was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8415;left:16"><nobr>little point in spending money educating them. But not my dad â€“ he wanted his first-born to be the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8439;left:16"><nobr>first in the family to pass class ten. Apa could have let me stay at home and then married me off early.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8462;left:16"><nobr>Heaven knows he didnâ€™t have the wherewithal to do much more. But I am proud that he dared to think</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8486;left:16"><nobr>differently, and grateful for the farsightedness that has brought me so far.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8509;left:41"><nobr>My first day at school was a great occasion for the family. Anu put aside all work, pulled on her</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8532;left:16"><nobr>Sunday best and dropped me to school. She walked me to the classroom and left. I felt a bit awkward</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8556;left:16"><nobr>wearing a uniform and sitting amongst lots of children. But I didnâ€™t cry like the others, most of whom</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8579;left:16"><nobr>were younger than me and feeling equally lost. Soon enough, I had made friends. I remember Ranjita</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8603;left:16"><nobr>and Sophiya, in whose company I spent my early school days. School and studies gradually became a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8626;left:16"><nobr>part of my routine.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:8706;left:41"><nobr>I used to walk to school every day â€“ a one-hour trek one way into town. I remember vaguely that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8730;left:16"><nobr>Mother accompanied me for a few months, and then I was left to go on my own with friends from the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8753;left:16"><nobr>village. This was by no means unusual. Parents in the villages are far too busy with their hard physical</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8776;left:16"><nobr>labour to mollycoddle their children. Anu would come to school only to pay my fees every month.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:8893;left:16"><nobr>had trained us to work from a young age. There were many jobs I could do that even the boys struggled</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8917;left:16"><nobr>with. All three of us siblings were given our chores, and as the eldest, I took my responsibilities very</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8940;left:16"><nobr>seriously. I helped in the fields, even with ploughing the fields â€“ a task that required immense strength,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8964;left:16"><nobr>because the bullocks were not easy to control. The menfolk would stand and gape, seeing me drive the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8987;left:16"><nobr>animals.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9010;left:41"><nobr>There were leeches in the wet rice fields, even the occasional water snakes. The leeches Iâ€™d pull</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9034;left:16"><nobr>off with my hands, and a well-aimed stone would knock out the snakes. Many years later, when I was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9057;left:16"><nobr>training at a boxing camp, my friends spotted a snake, screamed and ran away. I ran after the snake</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9081;left:16"><nobr>and knocked it out with just one kick. Seeing that, the others came running and killed it with sticks.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9104;left:41"><nobr>Apart from ploughing, work in the fields required handling heavy farming tools, carrying bundles</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9127;left:16"><nobr>of rice saplings for planting and later, sacks of rice. I would carry home the straw that was left over</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9151;left:16"><nobr>after harvesting, to store as cattle-feed. That aside, I would carry water across long distances, because</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9174;left:16"><nobr>we had no potable water in the village. I went up the hills with Apa to collect firewood and to the lake</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9198;left:16"><nobr>to fish. I was Apaâ€™s right-hand woman, but Anu needed me to help too. Cooking, washing clothes,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9221;left:16"><nobr>gardening, cleaning the house and various other odd jobs â€“ that was also part of my routine.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9244;left:41"><nobr>I was the older child and the one that both my parents leant on. Even now, if you ask my mother,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9268;left:16"><nobr>sheâ€™ll tell you I was an obedient child. But as I tended to our cows and ensured they were feeding well</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9291;left:16"><nobr>â€“ they were our most prized possessions â€“ I would look into the distance, where children were playing</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9315;left:16"><nobr>in the village grounds. I was envious, I admit. Which child wouldnâ€™t be? But looking back, it was that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9338;left:16"><nobr>sustained toil that prepared my body for boxing. My strength and stamina continue to be my strong</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9361;left:16"><nobr>points even when I fight bigger opponents in the ring.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9385;left:41"><nobr>Through those years, though, there was no time for regrets or complaints. My parents worked</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9408;left:16"><nobr>harder than anyone we knew and made endless sacrifices. Apa, for instance, was the village wrestling</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9432;left:16"><nobr>champion in his youth. But, with a wife and children to support, he had no time for that sort of leisure.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9455;left:16"><nobr>Anu, too, spent all her waking hours working: weaving, gardening, helping in the fields. She sold</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9478;left:16"><nobr>the shawls she wove to pay our school fees. All our vegetables came from her kitchen garden, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9502;left:16"><nobr>whatever was left over was sold in the market.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9525;left:41"><nobr>Itâ€™s another matter that, at the end of all this, we could not always pay our school fees on time â€“</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9549;left:16"><nobr>something that embarrassed us greatly. We were not allowed to enter the classroom or sit for exams</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9572;left:16"><nobr>when this happened. Anu tried her best to save us these unpleasant experiences, saving and scrimping</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9595;left:16"><nobr>as much as she could. God-fearing and hardworking, my mother is the strongest person I know.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9619;left:41"><nobr>Anu remembers me as an undemanding child. She says that I understood we were hard-up. Our</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9642;left:16"><nobr>big celebration in the year was Christmas. For many of us, it was the only time we got new clothes to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9666;left:16"><nobr>wear. Anu says that while I always accepted what was bought for me without fuss, and did not ask for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9689;left:16"><nobr>more, I preferred boyish clothes, like jeans or shorts and T-shirts, to frocks.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:9769;left:41"><nobr>There was one thing my siblings and I could not make our peace with. My father would sometimes</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9793;left:16"><nobr>leave home at the break of dawn to go hunting and fishing. Anu packed the dayâ€™s food for him, for he</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9816;left:16"><nobr>returned only after dark. We crowded around him excitedly then, waiting to see the catch of the day.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9839;left:16"><nobr>He was an expert at catching eels, which my parents would spread out in the kitchen. The big ones</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9863;left:16"><nobr>were exchanged for rice in the village. Much later, Anu told me how much it hurt her when the three</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9886;left:16"><nobr>of us would innocently ask why all the big fish were being sent away, leaving only the small ones for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9910;left:16"><nobr>us. Of course, only the big fish fetched a decent price. Apa still has a passion for fishing, except now</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9933;left:16"><nobr>he brings home only enough for a meal or so â€“ and he always ensures that the biggest ones are sent to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9956;left:16"><nobr>me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9980;left:41"><nobr>Apa was also an ace marksman. He claims that he has shot a hundred birds with hundred pellets</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10003;left:16"><nobr>of an air gun. Because he was such a skilled hunter, there was always smoked fish and meat hanging</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10027;left:16"><nobr>above the fireplace at home. We were poor, but we did not eat poorly. In later years, when I left home</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10050;left:16"><nobr>for training, Anu would pack some of that smoked meat for me, because it preserved well. It certainly</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10073;left:16"><nobr>lifted some of the weight, the sadness of being away from home.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10097;left:41"><nobr>For all the fishing, hunting and farming Apa did, and all the weaving and gardening Anu did, they</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10120;left:16"><nobr>did not always have enough to feed and educate three children. So there were times when Apa left</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10144;left:16"><nobr>home for months in search of work, usually to work as a woodcutter in the jungles of Ukhrul or Ta-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10167;left:16"><nobr>menglong, more than a hundred kilometres from home. There, he hired himself out as a contract la-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10190;left:16"><nobr>bourer. The mahajans only paid after the work was completed, which often took two or three months</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10214;left:16"><nobr>at a stretch. Deep inside the forest, the workers cut trees and then carried them long distances manually</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10237;left:16"><nobr>and stockpiled them on the road for transportation.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10261;left:41"><nobr>Apa says that there was only one truck that could drive up those rugged hills, the Shaktiman. The</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10284;left:16"><nobr>woodcutters had to wait for the truck to arrive, then load the wood on it, travel with it to the nearest</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10307;left:16"><nobr>town and return to the forest. He also remembers several near-death experiences from those days.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10331;left:16"><nobr>Once, while cutting wood, he fell from a high tree on to a thorn bush. He had cuts and bruises from</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10354;left:16"><nobr>the thorns that pierced his skin. There was no medication or treatment available deep in the jungle, so</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10378;left:16"><nobr>he just pulled out the thorns himself and waited for the wounds to heal on their own. Many a time,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10401;left:16"><nobr>he spent days alone in the forest. When he slept at night, it was always in a half-sitting position, so if</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10424;left:16"><nobr>an animal were to attack, he would be able to get up and escape quickly. His small, tough frame has</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10448;left:16"><nobr>endured a lot. When we talk of those times now, he has tears in his eyes. Is he happy or sad? A bit of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10471;left:16"><nobr>both, he says. â€˜Iâ€™m sad about the hard times, happy that youâ€™re so successful today.â€™</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:10599;left:16"><nobr>village then; we certainly couldnâ€™t afford one. So Apa would ask me to roll out the mat and study. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10622;left:16"><nobr>would be bone-tired, but this was the only time I could catch up on homework and other assignments.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10646;left:16"><nobr>I would sit down on the mat and pull a boton close to me. Candles were expensive, so we used these</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10669;left:16"><nobr>kerosene lamps made from used bottles and cotton wicks. They emitted a lot of smoke and only a very</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10693;left:16"><nobr>dim light.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10716;left:41"><nobr>One boton was enough for our entire house, which was just one room, with an attached kitchen. It</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10739;left:16"><nobr>was made of bamboo, plastered with a mix of mud, cow dung and straw, and covered with a thatched</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:10832;left:16"><nobr>roof. In it were two beds â€“ one for my sister and me, another for my parents and brother â€“ with mat-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10856;left:16"><nobr>tresses made of straw mixed with a little locally grown cotton. We would sew pieces of cloth together</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10879;left:16"><nobr>to make blankets. Neither our clothes, nor the blankets actually kept us warm. Winters were bitterly</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10902;left:16"><nobr>difficult. There was a string to hang clothes from and a trunk in which we stored our Sunday clothes.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10926;left:16"><nobr>Apa loved to tell the story of how he had saved money in his youth to buy a fine mattress made with</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10949;left:16"><nobr>the best local cotton. He lost it and though he does have an idea about who might have taken it, he</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10973;left:16"><nobr>does not want to make an issue of it. That sort of luxury was well beyond reach in his life as a family</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10996;left:16"><nobr>man.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11019;left:41"><nobr>I would do my homework as fast as I could, read a lesson or two and then get ready for bed. The</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11043;left:16"><nobr>moment my head touched the pillow, Iâ€™d fall asleep. In the morning, Apa called out, â€˜Wake up, Sana-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11066;left:16"><nobr>hen, you have to help me before school.â€™ How I longed to sleep just a little longer. But I always jumped</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11090;left:16"><nobr>out of the bed and got ready for the day. It was still dark outside while I washed up. All ready, I started</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11113;left:16"><nobr>the fire with a few dried twigs and boiled water in one of our few battered pots and pans. Father and I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11136;left:16"><nobr>had a cup of tea and set out. He reminded me when it was time for school. Iâ€™d rush back home, eat a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11160;left:16"><nobr>hurried lunch and set off.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11183;left:41"><nobr>My day used to be a rush all the way through. My feet were fast, but my hands were even faster,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11207;left:16"><nobr>trying to cope with work at home and at school.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11230;left:41"><nobr>By the time I set out for school, my friends were already on their way there. Iâ€™d run and catch up</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11253;left:16"><nobr>with them. Theyâ€™d say to me, â€˜Chungneijang, you run like the wind.â€™ The only shoes my parents could</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11277;left:16"><nobr>afford were made of rubber, and they would wear out quickly because of my long trek to school. But</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11300;left:16"><nobr>Anu became an expert at repairing them by heating iron tongs and pressing them together on the tear</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11324;left:16"><nobr>to join the pieces. By the time school term was over, the rubber shoes were ready to fall to pieces.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11347;left:41"><nobr>I didnâ€™t care that my shoes were patched up, or that my uniform was crushed. For me, school was a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11370;left:16"><nobr>chance to play with friends and learn things that my parents couldnâ€™t teach me. Still, I was a mediocre</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11394;left:16"><nobr>student. Every day, mother would give me 50 paise as tiffin money, with which I bought small packets</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11417;left:16"><nobr>of dried fruits, channa and Moreh pickles. At home, the only food available was whatever was left</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11441;left:16"><nobr>over from the dayâ€™s lunch. Sometimes not even that. During the season, I would climb a guava tree</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11464;left:16"><nobr>that grew behind the old church and eat my fill of ripe guavas after school. In fact, my family and I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11487;left:16"><nobr>often quelled our hunger with the seasonal fruits that grew in the village.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11511;left:41"><nobr>The church held a special significance in our lives. Although my parents worked hard through the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11534;left:16"><nobr>week, they rested on Sundays. It was a day spent in church and prayer, and relaxing with the family. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11558;left:16"><nobr>belong to the Baptist church, and have grown up with the strong conviction that God will answer my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11581;left:16"><nobr>prayers. In spite of our penury and deprivation, we did not ever lose faith in God. If anything, God was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11604;left:16"><nobr>the force that kept us going, fighting and hoping for better times. The Biblical story of David and Go-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11628;left:16"><nobr>liath has been a constant inspiration for me â€“ an identification deepened by my own diminutive size.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11651;left:16"><nobr>I have clear memories from my childhood, of going to church every single Sunday, reading the Bible,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11675;left:16"><nobr>listening to the priest, singing endless choruses and songs. To this day I fast and pray on a Sunday</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11698;left:16"><nobr>before any major championship, no matter where in the world I am.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11721;left:41"><nobr>The other thing I remember about those days is that there were not that many avenues for enter-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11745;left:16"><nobr>tainment in the village. Only a very few families could afford a television. My family could afford</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11768;left:16"><nobr>one only after I got my first prize money in 2002. But we would watch movies at my uncleâ€™s house</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11792;left:16"><nobr>sometimes. My favourite movies were the action-packed martial art films starring Bruce Lee, Jet Li</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:12012;left:16"><nobr>those martial arts heroes and my cousin Chungjalen was the usual recipient of my Bruce Lee kicks.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12036;left:16"><nobr>He and I were the eldest in our families and shared many good and bad times. As we tended cows or</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12059;left:16"><nobr>worked in the fields together the two of us would discuss our dreams of becoming rich and helping</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12082;left:16"><nobr>our parents.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12106;left:41"><nobr>Holidays werenâ€™t entertainment time either. Since my siblings and I were free from school, father</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12129;left:16"><nobr>would assign us other work and errands, like collecting firewood. Since we couldnâ€™t afford to stockpile</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12153;left:16"><nobr>firewood, like most other families, we had to pick up bits and pieces of leftover firewood. Apa and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12176;left:16"><nobr>the three of us kids would troop off to Ningthi Ching hills, about eight kilometres from our village.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12199;left:16"><nobr>He would climb high up and leave us waiting at the foothills to catch the firewood he threw down</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12223;left:16"><nobr>the slope. By evening weâ€™d have quite a bit and weâ€™d walk all that distance back with the load on our</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12246;left:16"><nobr>heads. Once Apa and I had gone to collect firewood by ourselves. He was high up on a hill and I was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12270;left:16"><nobr>waiting further down, holding on to a plant to keep from falling down. But the plant came right out of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12293;left:16"><nobr>off the ground and I went hurtling down into a hole. I blacked out. When I came to, I was lying flat</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12316;left:16"><nobr>on my face, hands and legs bruised. When Apa came down, I showed him my injuries. He felt terrible</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12340;left:16"><nobr>and checked to make sure that no bones were broken. We set off for home after resting awhile. All of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12363;left:16"><nobr>this no doubt inured me to the cuts and bruises I would endure in the course of my boxing life.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:12468;left:16"><nobr>that. In the midst of all the work, there were times Iâ€™d sneak out to play with friends. I was a champion</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12491;left:16"><nobr>marble player with a very sharp strike and usually ended up winning all of my friendsâ€™ marbles. So-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12514;left:16"><nobr>metimes I sold them their own marbles, at other times I lent them some so we could continue playing.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:12725;left:16"><nobr>pital. Fortunately, there was no serious injury, but I was terribly sorry. My brother and sister looked up</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12748;left:16"><nobr>to me. I was more like an elder brother than a sister to them. If anyone bullied them, they would have</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12772;left:16"><nobr>me to answer to. Once my brother came home crying because a bully had beaten him up. My brother</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12795;left:16"><nobr>pointed out the boy to me, and I went and twisted his ears so hard, he apologized and promised never</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12819;left:16"><nobr>to repeat his offence.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12842;left:41"><nobr>But there was another time when my brother was responsible for sending me to the hospital. We</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12865;left:16"><nobr>were playing hide-and-seek, and he was hiding behind a door. I didnâ€™t know that and peeped through</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:12958;left:16"><nobr>the keyhole. Suddenly, he poked a stick through it. Fortunately, it hit the white of the eye and caused</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12982;left:16"><nobr>no severe injury. With a bandage over my eye, I happily set off to play marbles with my friends â€“ it</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13005;left:16"><nobr>was perfect for taking aim.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13028;left:41"><nobr>I always looked forward to the annual games and sports meet in school, and competed in practically</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13052;left:16"><nobr>every individual sporting event: 100 metres, 400 metres, long-distance and so on. Then there were the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13075;left:16"><nobr>less serious events, like the spoon race (in which we ran the race with a spoon in our mouths, careful</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13099;left:16"><nobr>not to drop the marble balanced on it) and the needle race (run, thread a needle, run back). I bagged</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13122;left:16"><nobr>the first prize in most events I participated in. The prizes were household items like plates, cups and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13145;left:16"><nobr>tiffin boxes, much to my familyâ€™s delight. My brother was very excited about the tiffin box, because</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13169;left:16"><nobr>now he could take rice to school like his friends did.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13192;left:41"><nobr>As my focus moved to sports, my academic performance started sliding. Father was very distressed</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13216;left:16"><nobr>by this. He wanted his children to never have to face the discrimination and disadvantages that his own</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13239;left:16"><nobr>lack of education forced him to bear with. He did not want me to waste my time playing.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13262;left:41"><nobr>But we had more immediate concerns. Back in those days, pocket money was an unheard-of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13286;left:16"><nobr>concept, but my friends and I found ways to make small amounts. We would collect tins, containers</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13309;left:16"><nobr>and bottles and sell them to the hawker who collected and sold these things. One time, we went off</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13333;left:16"><nobr>to glean rice in the harvested fields of the rich landowners â€“ something that poor people did to collect</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13356;left:16"><nobr>rice. At the end of a dayâ€™s careful picking, grain by grain, we had but a small basket of rice, which we</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13379;left:16"><nobr>sold. Every now and then my brother ribs me about the fact that I am yet to give him his share of that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13403;left:16"><nobr>money! At other times, I picked wild vegetables and fruits and sold them. With this money, I would</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13426;left:16"><nobr>buy textbooks, pencils, erasers and so on. Sometimes Anu would borrow money from me, and then I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13450;left:16"><nobr>would remind her repeatedly to return it till she did.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13473;left:41"><nobr>After my class six exams, I was shifted to St Xavierâ€™s School, also in Moirang. I donâ€™t remember</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13496;left:16"><nobr>why I made the move. My brother was at Xavierâ€™s, and perhaps my parents wanted us to be in the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13520;left:16"><nobr>same school. The best thing about the new school was its huge playground. At the new school too, I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13543;left:16"><nobr>continued to participate and excel in all individual sports. So much so that my principal and teachers</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13567;left:16"><nobr>suggested that I should consider a career in sports. One day, the principal summoned Apa and sugges-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13590;left:16"><nobr>ted that he take me to the Sports Authority of India (SAI) in Imphal. This worried my father more than</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13613;left:16"><nobr>it pleased him. Where was he to find the resources to send his daughter to Imphal? He decided not to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13637;left:16"><nobr>think about it just yet.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13660;left:41"><nobr>But I still have my own little sporting memories from the time. The most vivid of those is the an-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13684;left:16"><nobr>nual meet of the Kom-Rem Studentsâ€™ Union at Thayong village in 1998. It was a gathering of Kom</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13707;left:16"><nobr>youth from all over Manipur. My parents tried to dissuade me from going. Perhaps they were worried</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13730;left:16"><nobr>about the expenses. But when I insisted they relented, and my friends and I set out. I travelled on the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13754;left:16"><nobr>roof of a bus with the boys throughout the eight-kilometre journey. I was happy and excited. Sitting</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13777;left:16"><nobr>at that height, a bright scarf around my head, I felt on top of the world. Nothing that followed â€“ my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13801;left:16"><nobr>first train ride, my first flight, my first visit abroad â€“ ever matched the sheer delight of that childhood</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13824;left:16"><nobr>journey. We reached in the evening and I was amazed at the beauty of the village and the scenery. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13847;left:16"><nobr>seem to remember someone telling me that Thayong is famous for its juicy pineapples. At the meet I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13871;left:16"><nobr>participated in all the athletic events and outshone the others easily. I made friends as well as quite a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13894;left:16"><nobr>name for myself in the community.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13918;left:41"><nobr>But back in the village life continued as before â€“ except that Apa had saved enough money by then</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13941;left:16"><nobr>to buy me a Captain bicycle. I would ride with my friends, my sister usually perched on the carrier at</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:15403;left:12"><nobr>enquiring about the best options available, so he could send me for further training. He wanted to find</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15426;left:12"><nobr>a way to indulge me without disturbing my school and studies.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15450;left:37"><nobr>He took me to Nipamacha Kunam, a National Institute of Sports (NIS)-trained coach, at Moirang.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15473;left:12"><nobr>Oja Nipamacha was an athletics coach and had nurtured many youngsters. I was thrilled when he ac-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15497;left:12"><nobr>cepted me as his student. â€˜Will you come early in the morning for exercises and training?â€™ he asked me</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15520;left:12"><nobr>sternly. I assured him I would do my best. There was no admission fee to this course, nor were there</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15543;left:12"><nobr>equipment charges. All I had to do was show up and train alongside the other athletes. The only concern</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15567;left:12"><nobr>was that I did not have a balanced diet to support my training.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15590;left:37"><nobr>Sure enough, the strain of cycling between Moirang and my village four times every day became</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15614;left:12"><nobr>too much. It was also clear to me that athletics was not my cup of tea. In about twenty days I gave up.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15637;left:12"><nobr>Still, there was a lot I learnt in that short stint, most crucially, the right techniques of exercise. I learnt</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15660;left:12"><nobr>stretching, exercises to build strength, stamina and speed training. We did a lot of running as well. My</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15684;left:12"><nobr>first coach commended me on my skills and told me I needed proper guidance to hone my talent. Even</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15707;left:12"><nobr>after I stopped going to the centre I kept up the exercise routine at home, hoping that another opportun-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15731;left:12"><nobr>ity would crop up. Sometimes I wonder how I sustained my passion given that I had neither exposure</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15754;left:12"><nobr>to the possibilities nor opportunities.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15777;left:37"><nobr>As people around me â€“ teachers and friends â€“ began to speak about my talent for sports, and as my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15801;left:12"><nobr>zeal continued unabated, Apaâ€™s acceptance of my sporting ambitions deepened. He began to consider</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15824;left:12"><nobr>the idea that my future lay in sports and not academics. He contacted relatives in Imphal so I could stay</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15848;left:12"><nobr>with them if I got an opportunity to develop my talents in that city, the capital of Manipur, the place</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15871;left:12"><nobr>where I had the best chance of learning and training. Though, at this stage, I really didnâ€™t have any idea</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15894;left:12"><nobr>about which sport I was going to pursue. Boxing? No, that wasnâ€™t even in my thoughts.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15918;left:37"><nobr>Apa began making enquiries about the SAI facility in Imphal. I was over the moon. In spite of my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15941;left:12"><nobr>limited exposure, I knew that SAI was the place with the best sporting facilities. We had visited Imphal</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15965;left:12"><nobr>on a school excursion in the late â€™90s. I remember that the Khuman Lampak Sports Stadium was then</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15988;left:12"><nobr>under construction for the upcoming National Games. Promptly, I began to make plans for the future. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16011;left:12"><nobr>would pursue a career in sports and get a job under the sports quota, and then I would help my parents</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16035;left:12"><nobr>so theyâ€™d no longer be poor. Jobs are scarce in Manipur and I had heard it said that the only way to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16058;left:12"><nobr>get one was either through political connections or with money, paying bribes. Never in a million years</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:16147;left:16"><nobr>would my parents save enough to buy me a job. But the sports quota was another way in. Once he had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16171;left:16"><nobr>accepted my dream, Apa took on my share of the work as well so that I would have more time to play.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16194;left:41"><nobr>I was about sixteen when Apa finally let me have my way and focus on sports. He had tried to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16217;left:16"><nobr>dissuade me over and again. He knew that poverty would not allow him to provide me with the kind</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16241;left:16"><nobr>of diet, equipment, clothes or money that I would need. He was hurt by the thought that my friends</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16264;left:16"><nobr>would think me pitiable. He never did speak about the possibility that I might get a job through the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16288;left:16"><nobr>sports quota, but I knew about it, even if the details of how it worked were hazy to me back then. Yet</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16311;left:16"><nobr>I persisted.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16334;left:41"><nobr>The fact is that I was never interested in the pursuits of girls around me. Most of my friends were</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16358;left:16"><nobr>boys â€“ although that was partly because there were very few girls of my age in the village. I was ener-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16381;left:16"><nobr>getic and restless. Also, quite frankly, neither my parents nor I thought I was particularly good-look-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16405;left:16"><nobr>ing. If anything, I was rather self-conscious about my boyish appearance and the fact that feminine</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16428;left:16"><nobr>clothes didnâ€™t look good on me. In all sorts of ways, sports always seemed like the way forward to me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16451;left:41"><nobr>Apa may not have been educated but he knew about life, and was keen to share with his children</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16475;left:16"><nobr>all that he knew. He would say to me, â€˜Sanahen, being a woman, you should be able to do everything.â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16498;left:16"><nobr>Or â€˜Donâ€™t tell lies. Be good and kind-hearted. Treat your elders with love and care.â€™ So I strove to learn</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16522;left:16"><nobr>how to run a home, and cook and clean â€“ even as I learnt to work alongside him and play alongside</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16545;left:16"><nobr>my peers.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16568;left:41"><nobr>The most significant lesson I learnt was one Apa taught me: of the dignity of hard labour and hon-</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:16862;left:16"><nobr>now having to do all the work, even the share I took care of. What would my siblings do? Now my</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:16909;left:41"><nobr>But I also felt that I was making the right move. We went to the home of Anuâ€™s nephew, Chun-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16932;left:16"><nobr>gthang, who was working with the Life Insurance Corporation. Mother explained to him that I was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16955;left:16"><nobr>moving to the city to pursue a career in sport. I remember with gratitude his warmth and hospital-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16979;left:16"><nobr>ity. Chungthang telephoned a colleague, who in turn helped us meet Coach Gosana at SAI Takyel. It</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17002;left:16"><nobr>seems surprising to me when I think about it now. But I really went to Imphal to try my luck, without</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17026;left:16"><nobr>admission. Fortunately, the coach was impressed by my determination and agreed to train me until it</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17049;left:16"><nobr>was time for the formal selection to be done. Chungthang advised me to choose an individual sport,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17072;left:16"><nobr>saying that it would have more scope. He also helped me get admission in Adimjati Government High</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17096;left:16"><nobr>School in Class IX. I hadnâ€™t had the benefit of many advisors and took my cousinâ€™s words seriously.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:17514;left:16"><nobr>ize with friends as there might be in a girlsâ€™ hostel. I preferred to do my own cooking and provide for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17538;left:16"><nobr>myself, which also ensured that I could live within my own budget. After some time, Sarita moved out</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17561;left:16"><nobr>but I stayed on, because the rent was cheap and about as much as I could afford.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17585;left:41"><nobr>One day I noticed that my stock of rice was over. There was a bandh the next day. Bandhs and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17608;left:16"><nobr>blockades are frequent occurrences in Manipur, politically sensitive and disturbed as the region is. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17631;left:16"><nobr>had no money. Reluctant to borrow from friends, I cycled four hours to Kangathei and brought back</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17655;left:16"><nobr>rice. It wasnâ€™t easy living alone in a rented house on next to nothing, but it did give me the freedom to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17678;left:16"><nobr>concentrate on my sport. My drive to succeed was so strong that it drove away all fear and apprehen-</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:17806;left:16"><nobr>various track and field sports. The coaches at the academy wanted to see what worked best for me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17829;left:16"><nobr>They felt that I might be suited for gymnastics but I thought I was probably too old to be starting out</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17853;left:16"><nobr>in a sport that girls take up when they are really small and more flexible. The truth is also that none</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17876;left:16"><nobr>of these sports really appealed to me. I wanted something like the martial arts, something with a lot</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17900;left:16"><nobr>of action. Unfortunately, SAI Takyel mostly catered to track and field disciplines. I realized very soon</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17923;left:16"><nobr>that I should leave before the formal selection for athletes was done.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17946;left:41"><nobr>I had joined SAI as an outsider â€“ by which I mean, just on the basis of an understanding between</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17970;left:16"><nobr>the coach and me â€“ so there was no strict rule about leaving. Though I did feel guilty about leaving</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17993;left:16"><nobr>without speaking to Oja Gosana.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18017;left:41"><nobr>At about that time there was talk that womenâ€™s boxing might be introduced at SAI. I was very ex-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18040;left:16"><nobr>cited. The idea of boxing appealed to me immensely. During the National Games in 1999 at Khuman</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18063;left:16"><nobr>Lampak, there had been an exhibition bout by senior women boxers L. Sarita Devi and Sandhyarani</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18087;left:16"><nobr>Devi. Sadly, I wasnâ€™t able to go see the matches. Then came the news that Dingko Singh, a Manipuri,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18110;left:16"><nobr>had won the gold in the 1998 Bangkok Asian Games, which led to a greater buzz around boxing in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18134;left:16"><nobr>the state. He was our newest icon. Although I had never seen Dingko, I secretly wished to be like him.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18157;left:16"><nobr>Talk was that Dingko had made that gold after having been dropped from the national team and then</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18180;left:16"><nobr>reinstated again. He was not a hero only to me, but to all of Manipur.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:18273;left:41"><nobr>Apart from Dingko, my other childhood icons were Muhammad Ali and his daughter Laila Ali.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18297;left:41"><nobr>But it was a chance meeting with Rebika Chiru, a boxer, that really set me on the right path. This</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18320;left:16"><nobr>was back in the days when I was still staying at Chungthangâ€™s home on K.R. Lane. Rebika would often</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18343;left:16"><nobr>walk past the house wearing a National Games tracksuit. I learnt that she was a boxer and arranged</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18367;left:16"><nobr>for my friends to introduce us. She told me that womenâ€™s boxing had already been introduced at SAI</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18390;left:16"><nobr>Khuman Lampak, and that she was among a handful of women training there. By this time, I had made</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18414;left:16"><nobr>up my mind that boxing was the sport I was looking for.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18437;left:41"><nobr>I started enquiring about admission to the Academyâ€™s course. I found out that the chief coach, L.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18460;left:16"><nobr>Ibomcha Singh, was one of the best boxing coaches at SAI. So I set off all by myself to meet him. A</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18484;left:16"><nobr>National Boxing Champion in 1986, who had won the bronze at Pune, he had also been selected to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18507;left:16"><nobr>represent India at the Presidentâ€™s Cup in Jakarta that year. But he was dropped at the last minute for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18531;left:16"><nobr>reasons I donâ€™t know. Frustrated and disappointed, he packed his bags, returned to Manipur and threw</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18554;left:16"><nobr>himself into training students. He has produced many outstanding boxers â€“ men and women â€“ from</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18577;left:16"><nobr>Manipur over the years.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18601;left:41"><nobr>I did not know back then that Oja Ibomcha was very particular about his training schedule. He did</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18624;left:16"><nobr>not talk to visitors, entertain phone calls or speak to parents during those hours. I had no idea what he</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18648;left:16"><nobr>looked like even. I walked into the hall. There were many students milling around. I enquired of sev-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18671;left:16"><nobr>eral of them, â€˜Who is Oja Ibomcha?â€™ Then a big, beefy man who looked like a Manipuri Mike Tyson</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18694;left:16"><nobr>walked up to me and said, â€˜I am Sir Ibomcha. What do you want with me?â€™ I told him right away that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18718;left:16"><nobr>I wanted him to coach me. He was taken aback at my boldness but I also aroused his curiosity. He</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18741;left:16"><nobr>asked me where I was from, who I was and who had sent me. To that last, I answered that Oja Gosana</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18765;left:16"><nobr>from SAI had sent me. Of course this wasnâ€™t true. I just blurted it out because I was intimidated. Truth</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18788;left:16"><nobr>be told, I had left Oja Gosanaâ€™s camp without even informing him. Ibomcha asked me to wait outside,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18811;left:16"><nobr>saying that he didnâ€™t like to be disturbed in the middle of a training session.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18835;left:41"><nobr>I sat outside, praying hard to God that everything should work out well. I was practically in tears.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18858;left:41"><nobr>Finally, Oja Ibomcha came out and called me over. â€˜Why do you want to join boxing?â€™ That day,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18882;left:16"><nobr>I was wearing a gold earring my mother had bought for me with her kitty money. â€˜You are a small,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18905;left:16"><nobr>frail girl. With your gold earring, you donâ€™t even look like a boxer. Boxing is for young boys.â€™ I must</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18928;left:16"><nobr>have looked devastated at this, for he quickly asked me about my parents, what they did and where I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18952;left:16"><nobr>was staying in Imphal. He was worried that if I was staying in a village far away, I wouldnâ€™t be able</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18975;left:16"><nobr>to maintain his strict training schedule: 6â€“9 a.m. and 3â€“6 p.m. His parting shot was, â€˜If youâ€™re really</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18999;left:16"><nobr>interested, you may join, but I am very strict about the routine and timing. If you canâ€™t keep up, donâ€™t</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19022;left:16"><nobr>join.â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19045;left:41"><nobr>I went away ecstatic. Finally, I would follow my dream. I did not, however, stay in the hostel.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19069;left:16"><nobr>Selections for the hostel were done through physical tests and performance-based evaluations by</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19092;left:16"><nobr>coaches.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19116;left:41"><nobr>A few days later, I began training. Oja Ibomcha was a hard taskmaster. But the rigorous exercises</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19139;left:16"><nobr>and training did not dull my enthusiasm one bit. I learnt fast. I came to realize that I was a born boxer,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19162;left:16"><nobr>with a natural, inborn style. All I needed to do was train and perfect my footwork and punches. My</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19186;left:16"><nobr>life so far had prepared me for the endurance training that is so essential to boxing, but not the specific</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19209;left:16"><nobr>skills that boxers need. Thatâ€™s what I had to learn and thatâ€™s what I focused on.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19233;left:41"><nobr>In fact, every now and then, I overworked myself, not knowing that it would have an adverse effect</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19256;left:16"><nobr>on my health. All I wanted to do was prove that being young, a girl and small-statured would not keep</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:20399;left:41"><nobr>This was the regimen I followed for most of my early years in boxing. Following a systematic,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20423;left:16"><nobr>well-balanced routine prepared my raw talent for the rigours of the sport. I also gathered that the best</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20446;left:16"><nobr>way to defeat an opponent was to be fast and furious. My coaches down the years also appeared to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20469;left:16"><nobr>agree that intimidating the opponent early on is good strategy.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20493;left:41"><nobr>I learnt all I could from Oja Ibomcha, and he remains one of my best coaches ever. The Govern-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20516;left:16"><nobr>ment of India recognized his contribution to the field of boxing by giving him the Dronacharya Award</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20540;left:16"><nobr>in 2010.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20563;left:41"><nobr>I was a novice in the boxing world back then. It was only later that I learnt about the unspoken</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20586;left:16"><nobr>rivalry between Manipurâ€™s various boxing circles. The state-run Youth Affairs and Sports (YAS) box-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20610;left:16"><nobr>ing academy was run by coach Narjit Singh, while Khoibi Salam was the secretary of the Manipur</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20633;left:16"><nobr>Amateur Boxing Association (MABA), of which Oja Kishan was the coach. I soon discovered that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20657;left:16"><nobr>there was a nexus between YAS and MABA, as a result of which students from SAI were often</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20680;left:16"><nobr>dropped during selections. There was also talk that SAI students may not be allowed to participate in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20703;left:16"><nobr>state-level tournaments.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20727;left:41"><nobr>I didnâ€™t want to take any chances, so I decided to leave SAI in order to qualify for the state-level</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20750;left:16"><nobr>tournament in May 2000. Oja Ibomcha knew how things worked and did not object when his students</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20774;left:16"><nobr>moved out of SAI. I had been boxing for a little over a month when I shifted to the state coaching</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20797;left:16"><nobr>facility. But after the competition, I came back to Ibomcha, as did several other boxers. This came to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20820;left:16"><nobr>be something of a pattern.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20844;left:41"><nobr>After leaving SAI, I approached Oja Narjit. He accepted me, and I trained for a few weeks under</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20867;left:16"><nobr>him. He was very dedicated to his work. Womenâ€™s boxing was a new department back then, with prac-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20891;left:16"><nobr>tically no facilities to support it. But the coach was enthusiastic and the girls were passionate, and so</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20914;left:16"><nobr>we managed without proper infrastructure. Most of us had come from places outside Imphal, and were</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20937;left:16"><nobr>struggling to find good, safe accommodation. Oja Narjit arranged for us to stay on campus at Khuman</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20961;left:16"><nobr>Lampak in one of the office building rooms. He personally came to check on us to ensure that we were</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20984;left:16"><nobr>safe. To us, he was both coach and guardian. His motto was: discipline, dedication, determination.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21008;left:16"><nobr>Today, with only a few years left before his superannuation, Oja Narjit still coaches his students in an</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21031;left:16"><nobr>open ring with just a roof over it. He hopes that the Ministry of Sports will upgrade the boxing arena</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21054;left:16"><nobr>in Khuman Lampak during his tenure.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21078;left:41"><nobr>Later, I shifted to MABA under Coach L. Kishan Singh, who ran a boxing club known as KYDC,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21101;left:16"><nobr>or the Konjungâ€“Hazari Youth Development Committee Club, which I represented in my first appear-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21125;left:16"><nobr>ance as a boxer. Oja Kishan was the youngest of my coaches, and a dedicated and hard-working teach-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21148;left:16"><nobr>er. Working with him, I honed the basics that I had learnt under Oja Ibomcha.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21171;left:41"><nobr>A few seniors had already been training at KYDC for about two years. Sarita was there, as were</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21195;left:16"><nobr>Sandhyarani, Th. Joymati and N. Asharani. I was excited and confident right from the start. Since</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21218;left:16"><nobr>most of the girls were from a higher weight category, I practised with Sushila Devi and Bibi, the only</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21242;left:16"><nobr>two from my category. My sparring partners tended to be junior boys in the 40â€“45 kg category. My</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21265;left:16"><nobr>punches were too much for the girls, so I had no choice but to spar with the boys, who were of my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21288;left:16"><nobr>height but younger. I matched their strength and stamina in boxing hits.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21312;left:41"><nobr>In just three months, I had trained under three coaches. All of these coaches enriched my game and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21335;left:16"><nobr>my insight into it. They must have done something right, for in my very first State Championships, I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21359;left:16"><nobr>defeated Humbi in the finals; she had been one of my coaches when I first started boxing at SAI.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:21567;left:16"><nobr>is that at that time, a number of factors came together, and all these organizations and various people</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21590;left:16"><nobr>within them contributed to producing world-class boxers, both male and female, in Manipur. Dingko</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:21660;left:16"><nobr>ternational championships. All of us stepped into the world of boxing under the guidance of the stateâ€™s</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21684;left:16"><nobr>coaches.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21707;left:41"><nobr>The Indian Amateur Boxing Federation (IABF), with permission from AIBA, the governing body</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21730;left:16"><nobr>of the sport, gave the green signal for the introduction of womenâ€™s boxing in 1998, but in Manipur,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21754;left:16"><nobr>coaches had been enrolling and training women enthusiastically since 1996. The sport became more</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21777;left:16"><nobr>popular after the exhibition bout at the 1999 National Games in Khuman Lampak, which I could not</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21801;left:16"><nobr>make it to. Several girls from Manipur, including Sandhyarani, Sarita and Geeta Chanu featured in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21824;left:16"><nobr>the exhibition matches. That the Manipur Boxing Association (MBA), under the guidance of Khoibi</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21847;left:16"><nobr>Salam, took the lead in introducing the sport before any other state in the country is admirable though</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21871;left:16"><nobr>not surprising, given that it is women who contribute the most to household finances in Manipur. They</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21894;left:16"><nobr>work both inside and outside the home. In sport too, then, women find opportunities and encourage-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21918;left:16"><nobr>ment in the state.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21941;left:41"><nobr>This early start is in good measure responsible for how well women boxers from Manipur have</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21964;left:16"><nobr>done in competitions. Between 2000 and 2006, Manipur dominated womenâ€™s boxing. But now, states</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21988;left:16"><nobr>like Haryana, which have more resources, are entering the fray seriously and doing very well.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22011;left:41"><nobr>That said, as far as coaches go, Manipur has been particularly fortunate. Oja Ibomcha has been</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22035;left:16"><nobr>working at SAI, teaching the many students he has taken under his wing, with dedication and enthu-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22058;left:16"><nobr>siasm. Oja Narjit at YAS had begun boxing while in the army, a job he left so he could teach boxing.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22081;left:16"><nobr>At the MBA, the secretary, Khoibi Salam, and Oja Kishan have handled the selection and coaching</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22105;left:16"><nobr>of boxers. Oja Kishan also trains students in his own house, even though there is no boxing ring or</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22128;left:16"><nobr>gym there. I was one of his early students (just before the May 2000 tournament), and I remember that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22152;left:16"><nobr>he commended me saying, â€˜She performs even better than what sheâ€™s taught.â€™ I remember, too, that a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22175;left:16"><nobr>group of women boxers and I stayed in his house for some time, until we could to find accommoda-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22198;left:16"><nobr>tion close by. The coaches, every one of them, spared no effort. They were also sensitive to the fact</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22222;left:16"><nobr>that most of us were from low-income families and far-flung areas and villages. We often had to travel</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22245;left:16"><nobr>great distances to reach the training venue. At times we were irregular because we just did not have</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22269;left:16"><nobr>enough bus fare. Through all of this, our coaches were understanding, less strict than we thought they</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22292;left:16"><nobr>would be. (Although this was not always the case for those selected to SAI; Oja Ibomcha was known</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22315;left:16"><nobr>to be very strict.)</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22339;left:41"><nobr>As inspiring as our coaches were, I picked up early on that there was a system to be negotiated.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22362;left:16"><nobr>That I had to be at the right place at the right time. The rules as they stood gave MBA the power to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22386;left:16"><nobr>select boxers, which meant that the athletes coached by the state coach were the ones who were eli-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22409;left:16"><nobr>gible for selection to the state team. This has been a constant source of conflict between MBA and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22432;left:16"><nobr>SAI. With its resources coming from the Centre, SAI has better infrastructure, boxing equipment and</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:22525;left:16"><nobr>hostel facilities. So students often shift to SAI to train there. But when itâ€™s time for selection they have</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22549;left:16"><nobr>no choice but to go back to the State Boxing Centre.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22572;left:41"><nobr>Not only does this rule inconvenience players, it creates a highly avoidable rift among the coaches.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22595;left:16"><nobr>Groupism and favouritism are the inevitable consequences of it. The boxing community in Manipur is</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22619;left:16"><nobr>like two war camps, ever in readiness to fight one another. I shuttled between them to ensure that I kept</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22642;left:16"><nobr>both happy. I was interested only in furthering my sporting career and could have done without this</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22666;left:16"><nobr>sort of unpleasantness. I do not doubt for a moment the sincerity of our coaches. They were committed</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22689;left:16"><nobr>to producing very good players but every coach wanted the entire credit for himself. The atmosphere</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22712;left:16"><nobr>among the students was one of insecurity. If I train at SAI my chances of getting to the Nationals are</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22736;left:16"><nobr>low. If I train only at the state coaching centre my performance tends to go down because SAI has</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22759;left:16"><nobr>better coaches and better facilities. If the MBA and SAI joined hands they would turn out many more</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22783;left:16"><nobr>world-class boxers than the handful that have managed to navigate the system.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22806;left:41"><nobr>I single-handedly fought my way through these hurdles. I had no one to favour me so I proved my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22829;left:16"><nobr>worth through my performances alone. Khoibi Sir acknowledged this later, once I started winning. He</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22853;left:16"><nobr>said that my ability was God-gifted. I functioned like a computer in the ring, he said, forward, back-</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:23004;left:16"><nobr>months. I went home only when I needed money or rice. Imphal was unfamiliar terrain for my parents,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23027;left:16"><nobr>so they too did not venture there often. Apa farmed, Anu grew vegetables and wove clothes. They</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23051;left:16"><nobr>barely had time to enquire after my well-being. This did not upset me at all. I knew it was because</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23074;left:16"><nobr>their life was hard and not a lack of love or concern for me. Besides, it left me free to pursue excel-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23098;left:16"><nobr>lence in boxing. As far as possible, I tried not to make any further demands on my parents, managing</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23121;left:16"><nobr>on whatever they could spare for me â€“ Rs 50, occasionally Rs 100, a month.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23144;left:41"><nobr>I handled the many decisions and upheavals of life in Imphal â€“ admission, choosing coaches, get-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23168;left:16"><nobr>ting my gloves and guards â€“ on my own. I bought my first gloves with Rs 350 that I had saved from</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23191;left:16"><nobr>my pocket money. In fact, at that point I hadnâ€™t even told my parents about my decision to take up</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23215;left:16"><nobr>boxing. I trained without proper equipment, because they were expensive. More than anything else,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23238;left:16"><nobr>I wanted a pair of comfortable shoes, but I couldnâ€™t afford one. I managed with a pair bought from</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23261;left:16"><nobr>Moreh market, a cheap imitation of the original brands. Even when I went for the Nationals, my shoes</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23285;left:16"><nobr>were tattered â€“ not that I let it bother me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23308;left:41"><nobr>But Iâ€™m skipping ahead â€“ before that came my first State Womenâ€™s Boxing Championships. I was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23332;left:16"><nobr>selected to play in the 48 kg category. But later, I was told that Iâ€™d have to play at a higher weight</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23355;left:16"><nobr>category to make way for anther boxer. â€˜Iâ€™d rather not play at all,â€™ I told the selection committee. I had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23378;left:16"><nobr>just entered the world of boxing, and didnâ€™t want to start out by being manipulated. Eventually, they</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23402;left:16"><nobr>changed their mind. I went on to win the gold, and was also unanimously awarded the Best Boxer of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23425;left:16"><nobr>the Tournament. Although there was no money to be won in this tournament, it secured me a place in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23449;left:16"><nobr>the state selections and gave me a chance to prove myself at the national level. I was elated, but kept</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23472;left:16"><nobr>the joy to myself because my family didnâ€™t yet know about my shift to boxing. I had to find a way to</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:23588;left:41"><nobr>As it happened, the matter was taken out of my hands. A local newspaper reported on the State</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23612;left:16"><nobr>Championships with my name misspelt as â€˜Maki Komâ€™. Apa was on his way to Moirang on a cycle</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23635;left:16"><nobr>when he overheard a few men reading the local newspaper and talking about how even women had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23658;left:16"><nobr>started boxing. He had cycled on quite a distance before he suddenly became curious about it. He went</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23682;left:16"><nobr>back to them and asked to see the paper. He read it through and peered at the grainy photograph. He</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23705;left:16"><nobr>didnâ€™t know of any Kom girl at SAI other than his own daughter.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23729;left:41"><nobr>But of course, his daughter was called â€˜Chungneijangâ€™, not â€˜Makiâ€™. The thing is, when I first joined</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23752;left:16"><nobr>SAI Takyel, my friends couldnâ€™t get their tongues around my name. Coach Gosana pronounced it per-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23775;left:16"><nobr>fectly but almost no one else could. My friends told me that I should have a second name, one that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23799;left:16"><nobr>could be easily pronounced. I kept thinking about it and then one day, on the spur of the moment, I told</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23822;left:16"><nobr>them to call me â€˜Maryâ€™. The name would do both, signify my Christian faith and be easy to pronounce</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23846;left:16"><nobr>and remember. I informed my coach about my decision to change my name, but not my parents or</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23869;left:16"><nobr>relatives. In fact, one day Chungthang visited the Academy and asked for â€˜Chungneijangâ€™, but no one</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23892;left:16"><nobr>in the hostel knew anyone by that name. Finally he explained that he was looking for a â€˜Kom girlâ€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23916;left:16"><nobr>and found out that I was now known as Mary. He was taken aback. When he met me that day, he ad-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23939;left:16"><nobr>vised me to also keep my original name, because it was derived from my grandmotherâ€™s name and it</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23963;left:16"><nobr>would hurt her to see me lose it. That struck a chord. My name in official documents today is: Mangte</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23986;left:16"><nobr>Chungneijang Mary Kom, although I am mostly just called M.C. Mary Kom. â€˜Maryâ€™ has been a very</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24009;left:16"><nobr>lucky name for me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24033;left:41"><nobr>To return to the story: Apa was still puzzled. He took the newspaper to Thangneireng Serto, one of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24056;left:16"><nobr>the most educated men in my village. Serto explained that womenâ€™s boxing was being developed as</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24080;left:16"><nobr>an independent sport, and that the newspaper reported that a â€˜Maki Komâ€™ had won the gold. Uneasy,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24103;left:16"><nobr>Father despatched my mother the next morning, telling her to bring me back on the pretext of discuss-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24126;left:16"><nobr>ing an urgent matter. Anu had to cajole me into returning home. I wasnâ€™t looking forward to confront-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24150;left:16"><nobr>ing Apa.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24173;left:41"><nobr>The first thing he asked me was, â€˜Why? But why are you interested in boxing? You didnâ€™t even tell</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24197;left:16"><nobr>me about it. I had to learn about it from the newspaperâ€™. With a stern look he added, â€˜I do not like it at</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24220;left:16"><nobr>all. Stop it before itâ€™s too late.â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24243;left:41"><nobr>â€˜I like boxing, and will not stop. Please understand, Apa,â€™ I said.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24267;left:41"><nobr>He paused to think about it and replied gently, â€˜You are a girl. One day, you will get married.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24290;left:16"><nobr>Should anything happen, should you get injured, it will be a big problem. Many boxers get serious</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24314;left:16"><nobr>injuries; I have seen blood streaming down their faces. If you get injured, it will cost a lot of money,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24337;left:16"><nobr>which I do not have.â€™ Apa remembered that I used to devour martial arts movies, that I wanted to be</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24360;left:16"><nobr>like the fighters in them. â€˜If youâ€™re really interested in combat, why donâ€™t you join judo or karate?â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24384;left:41"><nobr>But I was adamant. I told him that boxing was my dream sport; I could not possibly give it up. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24407;left:16"><nobr>explained that amateur boxing was not as dangerous as he thought it was. I explained all the rules and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24431;left:16"><nobr>about the protective gear we had to wear while playing.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24454;left:41"><nobr>Eventually he calmed down. He realized that I would not relent. He said that if I refused to give it</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24477;left:16"><nobr>up now, I must pursue it seriously, keep at it. Then he said that he felt incompetent as a father because</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24501;left:16"><nobr>I would be undernourished when compared to the others because of our financial problems. I assured</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24524;left:16"><nobr>him that I could manage without putting any additional burden on him. Of course, I had no idea how I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24548;left:16"><nobr>might do this, or where I could find the stipends and funds I so badly needed. Everything looked bleak,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24571;left:16"><nobr>but all I knew was that boxing was the only thing I really wanted to learn and master.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:24838;left:41"><nobr>The first time I went to meet Oja Ibomcha, he had commented on the gold earrings I wore. Those</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24862;left:16"><nobr>too had been bought with my motherâ€™s hard-earned extra income and they sat quite badly on my boy-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24885;left:16"><nobr>ish face. I had desperately wanted shoes, like my friends in the village had, but Anu had insisted on</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24909;left:16"><nobr>buying me the gold. But that was then. Once my parents accepted that I was going to be a boxer, our</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24932;left:16"><nobr>resources were all redirected to support my dream.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24955;left:41"><nobr>There was this one time during those days in Imphal when I lost the money that Anu had sent me</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24979;left:16"><nobr>for a tracksuit. It was a princely sum and I didnâ€™t know how to tell her about it. Ultimately, I gathered</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25002;left:16"><nobr>the courage to do so. She didnâ€™t complain or grumble, just quietly went back to saving up enough all</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25026;left:16"><nobr>over again.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25049;left:41"><nobr>What did I hope to gain from my game and from putting my parents through all this? The truth is</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25072;left:16"><nobr>that I loved to play. My body was fit and my mind raring to go. But I also hoped that I would get a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25096;left:16"><nobr>government job through the sports quota. I remember telling Anu: â€˜I will buy you lots of things one</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25119;left:16"><nobr>day. I will buy myself a Pulsar bike with my first prize money. For Apa, Iâ€™ll buy a farm, and for you</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25143;left:16"><nobr>a four-wheeler.â€™ It was a joke at the time, but also a secret wish. My father was cutting wood some</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25166;left:16"><nobr>distance away. He heard us and turned around to ask why we were laughing. Anu and I just laughed</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25189;left:16"><nobr>some more and cooked up even more elaborate dreams. My mom and dad are like friends to me, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25213;left:16"><nobr>moments like these only deepened my longing to help them live a better life.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:25504;left:16"><nobr>that struck me was that I had never seen so many people in one place. I was delighted by the pace and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25528;left:16"><nobr>colour of this new world. I won a gold in that tournament, sealing a berth in the Manipur state team.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:25714;left:16"><nobr>womenâ€™s boxing team and Oja Kishan, who accompanied us, proceeded to Bangalore from there. That</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25738;left:16"><nobr>was my very first training camp.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25761;left:41"><nobr>At the camp, we followed a routine of different exercises for the various days of the week. There</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25784;left:16"><nobr>was speed training and workouts in the gym. I worked out on the pad to hit and perfect different</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25808;left:16"><nobr>punches, and used a punching bag to develop punching techniques. Shadow boxing, sparring bouts</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25831;left:16"><nobr>with different partners and various other forms of exercises were all part of the carefully planned regi-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25855;left:16"><nobr>men.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25878;left:41"><nobr>But the trip to Chennai was historic for me in one other way: it was the first time I travelled by</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25901;left:16"><nobr>train. I had expected the train to be bigger and cleaner, like in the movies. That was a disappointment.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25925;left:16"><nobr>Besides, we were travelling without reservations, so we had to sit near the toilets. It was only later that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25948;left:16"><nobr>I discovered that trains do have first-class and air-conditioned compartments. But back then, we had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25972;left:16"><nobr>no money, so all of us travelled by the cheapest option. At least we were all together and that was fun.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25995;left:41"><nobr>I had often heard that Bangalore was one of the best cities in India. So when I found out that the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26018;left:16"><nobr>training camp was to be there, I was very excited. But it didnâ€™t get off to a good start. I had just taken</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26042;left:16"><nobr>my luggage up to my room when a teammate arrived to tell me that our coach had summoned us.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26065;left:16"><nobr>Leaving my things where they were, I went to the meeting, where Oja Kishan briefed us about the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26089;left:16"><nobr>rules and regulations of the place. When I returned, my purse was gone, with all my money in it. So</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26112;left:16"><nobr>was the athlete I had seen in the room earlier. I had no idea that such things could happen. I knew no</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26135;left:16"><nobr>one in Bangalore and didnâ€™t know whom to ask for money. Finally, I called an uncle, Songboi Serto,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26159;left:16"><nobr>in Imphal. He was a childhood friend of my fatherâ€™s and I had stayed with him for a few months in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26182;left:16"><nobr>Imphal. His friend in Mangalore, Angam Rimai, travelled forty kilometres to bring me some money.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26206;left:16"><nobr>To this day I remember that incident with relief and gratitude. I also wonder at the network of the tiny</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26229;left:16"><nobr>Kom community that it managed to provide help to a young girl stranded with no support so far away</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26252;left:16"><nobr>from home.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26276;left:41"><nobr>This was no isolated incident either. Over and over again in my sporting journey, family, friends</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26299;left:16"><nobr>and strangers have helped and supported me. There were, for instance, Uncle L. Lenpu and his wife</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26323;left:16"><nobr>Kipnu in Imphal, who had asked my father if they could adopt me and take care of my needs. Uncle</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26346;left:16"><nobr>had a strong intuition that I could be successful if I had the right support and guidance.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26369;left:41"><nobr>Another overwhelming memory is of my journey to Hisar for training and selection to the First</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26393;left:16"><nobr>Asian Womenâ€™s Boxing Championship Meet, also in 2001. We had planned this journey in advance</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26416;left:16"><nobr>and our tickets were booked. Then we were told that the Manipur Boxing Association was organizing</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26440;left:16"><nobr>the Churachand Memorial Boxing Tournament and that it was compulsory for all national-level play-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26463;left:16"><nobr>ers to compete. This was shattering news because the Hisar training camp was also a selection camp</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26486;left:16"><nobr>for an international championship. Rajesh Bhandari of the Indian Amateur Boxing Federation (IABF)</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26510;left:16"><nobr>questioned why the Manipur team was missing from Hisar. He called the secretary of MABA and told</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26533;left:16"><nobr>him that our presence in the camp was compulsory. So once again, we prepared to go to Hisar. We</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26557;left:16"><nobr>managed to get tickets, but not in the same compartment. This time I was extra careful and locked my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26580;left:16"><nobr>suitcase to the seat with an iron chain. We were passing through Bihar at night. When I woke up, as</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26603;left:16"><nobr>the train pulled into Gorakhpur, I saw that the chain had been cut and my suitcase stolen. This time it</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26627;left:16"><nobr>wasnâ€™t only money but all my belongings â€“ including my passport, which I had obtained in advance,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26650;left:16"><nobr>hoping to be selected for the international competition â€“ that had been stolen. I burst into loud sobs. It</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26674;left:16"><nobr>was more than I could deal with. I even considered jumping off the train and just dying. But I couldnâ€™t</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26697;left:16"><nobr>do that to my parents. My friends and our coach tried to console me, and assured me that they would</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:26777;left:16"><nobr>all do what they could to help. We reached Delhi, reported the loss at a police station and then pro-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26801;left:16"><nobr>ceeded to Hisar.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26824;left:41"><nobr>Although my coach and friends contributed money for my immediate needs, I was so anguished</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26847;left:16"><nobr>that I called Apa and told him that I wanted to die. â€˜Donâ€™t say things like that. I will do all I can to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26871;left:16"><nobr>get you a new passport. You concentrate on your training,â€™ he assured me. But how would they raise</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26894;left:16"><nobr>that sort of money again? I couldnâ€™t concentrate. Later, I learnt that they had sold our only cow, my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26918;left:16"><nobr>brotherâ€™s favourite pet. Apparently, he had cried for long after her new owners took the cow away. My</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26941;left:16"><nobr>mother set herself to working almost without a break to raise the money. But, of course, none of this</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26964;left:16"><nobr>would be quite enough.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26988;left:41"><nobr>My parents are proud people who would not stoop to borrowing as long as they could earn with</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27011;left:16"><nobr>their own hands, even if it meant working through the day and night. As my needs and expenses in-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27035;left:16"><nobr>creased, they stretched themselves through blood and sweat to meet my demands.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27058;left:41"><nobr>At Hisar I was selected for the championship. But without a passport I would be replaced. Although</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27081;left:16"><nobr>he was reluctant to trouble anyone or ask for favours, my father visited Uncle Songboi, who came</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27105;left:16"><nobr>to my rescue once again. He reproached my father for not telling him earlier and entrusted a certain</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27128;left:16"><nobr>L. Songkhup Kom with the responsibility of collecting money from among the Koms in the Greater</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27152;left:16"><nobr>Imphal area. He also telephoned an officer in the passport office whom he was acquainted with. The</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27175;left:16"><nobr>officer told him, â€˜A new passport in a day? Mr Songboi, you are asking for a miracle.â€™ But when the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27198;left:16"><nobr>situation was explained to him, he did indeed perform that little bit of magic. Uncle Songboiâ€™s brother,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27222;left:16"><nobr>Ahmang, flew to Guwahati with all the required documents. Another uncle, L. Kailun, who was the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27245;left:16"><nobr>superintendent of police, Imphal East, helped speed up the paperwork. As soon as the passport was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27269;left:16"><nobr>ready, it was despatched to Delhi, where Onler Kom â€“ whom I knew, if not very well back then â€“ col-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27292;left:16"><nobr>lected it and set off to deliver it to me in Hisar, six hours away. It was a turning point in our friendship.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27315;left:41"><nobr>It was a surreal moment when I held the passport in my hand. I heaved a massive sigh of relief and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27339;left:16"><nobr>sent up a prayer for the goodwill of friends and relatives, and the tireless efforts of my parents.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27362;left:41"><nobr>I had been praying earnestly all this while, of course, trying to find a way to calm my anxiety. In</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27386;left:16"><nobr>the course of those prayers I had thought about the talisman father had given me. His friends had given</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27409;left:16"><nobr>it to him and told him that it would ward off evil and protect me. I had tied it around my arm to please</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27432;left:16"><nobr>him. It occurred to me now that believing in charms was contradictory to our faith, so I took it off and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27456;left:16"><nobr>threw it away. I decided instead to believe in God. It may sound strange to you, my readers, especially</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27479;left:16"><nobr>those of you who have never been believers, but ever since I threw that talisman away, my run of bad</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27503;left:16"><nobr>luck ended.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27526;left:41"><nobr>I was able to travel to Bangkok â€“ another first, my first foreign journey. But all the stress and worry</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27549;left:16"><nobr>took its toll and I was defeated in my very first bout. My confidence was at its lowest then. When I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27573;left:16"><nobr>saw my opponent â€“ bigger than me, with well-formed muscles â€“ I became nervous. She looked strong</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27596;left:16"><nobr>and confident and had the support of the home crowd. I went down tamely.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27620;left:41"><nobr>But it was a big lesson for me. I vowed that I would never give up so easily again, that I would</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27643;left:16"><nobr>fight with my mind as well as with my body. The next international meet was only a few months away:</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27666;left:16"><nobr>the World Championships in the US. I would make my mark there, I promised myself.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:28323;left:12"><nobr>should meet the two members of Parliament (MPs) from Manipur and seek their help. They did just</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:28346;left:12"><nobr>that. The two MPs â€“ Holkhomang Haokip and Choaba Singh â€“ donated Rs 5,000 and Rs 3,000 respect-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:28370;left:12"><nobr>ively and I suddenly had Rs 10,000 in my hands. With this princely sum, and a little more that had been</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:28393;left:12"><nobr>collected from the community, I left for the US. I was relieved to have money in my pocket, and knew</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:28416;left:12"><nobr>that I could not come back empty-handed after all the efforts that people had made on my behalf.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:28440;left:37"><nobr>Pennsylvania was cold and beautiful. It was snowing. We were confined to the sports arena, but</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:28463;left:12"><nobr>what little I saw was pleasing to the eye. The people there were enormously nice too. It was the first</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:28487;left:12"><nobr>time in my life that I had travelled so far. I was looking forward to seeing what America was all about.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:28510;left:12"><nobr>But since we were the last team to arrive, we went straight to the sporting arena from the airport. The</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:28533;left:12"><nobr>other teams had already completed their weighing in, which is compulsory for all players. I was very</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:28557;left:12"><nobr>tired and suffering from jet lag. It had been morning when I left, and here it was morning again. After</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:28580;left:12"><nobr>the weighing in, I found out that I did not have any match that day. I was fortunate, but some of my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:28604;left:12"><nobr>team-mates were not so lucky. I was able to rest well enough to face my opponent in the first round,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:28627;left:12"><nobr>which I won comfortably. My fear of facing new opponents quickly vanished. I competed in the 48 kg</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:28650;left:12"><nobr>in this championship. While my team-mates lost one after the other, I went on to reach the finals. I was</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:28721;left:12"><nobr>telling myself, â€˜I can face anyone in the ring.â€™ In the quarter-final, I defeated Nadia Hokmi of Poland by</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:28767;left:12"><nobr>and risks getting hurt badly), and in the semi-final, I defeated Jamie Behl of Canada 21â€“9. I reached the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:28791;left:12"><nobr>finals, but lost to Hula Sahin of Turkey 13â€“5.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:28903;left:41"><nobr>The greatest disadvantage for me was my loss of appetite. I was not accustomed to the food there.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:28927;left:16"><nobr>Try as I might, I could not eat the food and I started to lose weight. So much so that just before the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:28950;left:16"><nobr>finals I was only 46 kg. This is probably what cost me my dream of winning gold and I was very</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:28973;left:16"><nobr>disappointed. I went to my room and cried. I was convinced that I was being punished because I had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:28997;left:16"><nobr>fought with my father just before I left for the US. But the coaches were kind; they consoled me and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29020;left:16"><nobr>lauded me on the silver win. I was the only one in the team to get a medal. But the biggest thing I took</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29044;left:16"><nobr>away from this championship was the conviction that I could take on any boxer.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29067;left:41"><nobr>Everything in the US was awfully expensive. I returned home with a few candies for my family,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29090;left:16"><nobr>and the Rs 2,000 that Apa had given me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29114;left:41"><nobr>In the course of my career, I have become used to travel and to the different ways that things work</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29137;left:16"><nobr>in other countries. But I remember this trip to the US with complete clarity. During practice, I would</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29161;left:16"><nobr>sweat profusely, so right after play, I needed a hot bath to prevent my body from becoming stiff. The</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29184;left:16"><nobr>bathroom had a bathtub, which I wasnâ€™t used to. It had two taps, one with â€˜Hâ€™ written in red, and the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29207;left:16"><nobr>other with â€˜Câ€™ written in blue. The first time, I opened the â€˜Hâ€™ tap and left the room. When I went back</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29231;left:16"><nobr>to check, the water was only lukewarm. Too embarrassed to ask someone what the problem might be,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29254;left:16"><nobr>I quietly bathed in that barely warm water in the cold winter.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29278;left:41"><nobr>That wasnâ€™t the only time. The plumbing in many European countries is so different from what we</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29301;left:16"><nobr>have at home. Once I turned a tap the wrong way and hot water came gushing out, scalding my hands.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29324;left:16"><nobr>And the electric switches are also so unfamiliar that it takes me a while to figure out the right way to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29348;left:16"><nobr>get a light or the air conditioner working. At times Iâ€™ve slept with the light on the whole night because</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29371;left:16"><nobr>I couldnâ€™t manage to switch it off and was too embarrassed to ask for help.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29395;left:41"><nobr>My friends must have had their own share of embarrassing experiences but most of us were too</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29418;left:16"><nobr>shy to relate these even to each other. I did share some of my stories with Sarita and Jenny, and we all</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29441;left:16"><nobr>laughed about them together.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29465;left:41"><nobr>Another time, in China, we were given chopsticks to eat our meals with. Just when I had painfully</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29488;left:16"><nobr>begun to master the art of using a knife and fork, I had to use two sticks to fill my stomach. I ended up</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29512;left:16"><nobr>using both my hands to hold the chopstick to pick up the food and push it into my mouth. My team-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29535;left:16"><nobr>mates asked for spoons but I tried to manage with the sticks. It helped that I really enjoy Chinese food.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29558;left:16"><nobr>I was hungry enough that I managed the complex work required â€“ I ate enough to sate my appetite and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29582;left:16"><nobr>my palate. In fact, as far as food is concerned, I like most of the food in Asia, but Continental food is</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29605;left:16"><nobr>too sweet for my liking. After five years of travelling, I started taking along some packed food from</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29629;left:16"><nobr>home, including chutney, dried meat and fish to get me through my stays in European countries.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:30013;left:41"><nobr>My community was proud that I was now an international-level boxer. It was the first sporting</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:30083;left:16"><nobr>the world over. We are just a few thousand people. I hoped that by coming up in sports and getting</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30107;left:16"><nobr>known worldwide, Iâ€™d be able to popularize the culture and ethos of my tiny tribe. When I spoke to the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:30177;left:41"><nobr>Anu had borrowed money from her sister to hire a vehicle to bring my family to Imphal, so excited</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30200;left:16"><nobr>was she at my achievement. We had been through a lot as a family so I could get where I had and it</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30224;left:16"><nobr>looked like, finally, things would change for us; that all our sacrifices were worth it. It seemed like my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30247;left:16"><nobr>decision to leave my family and go away to Imphal despite our meagre resources had been the right</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30270;left:16"><nobr>one.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30294;left:41"><nobr>The medal certainly helped our finances in a big way. The Sports Ministry announced a cash award</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30317;left:16"><nobr>of Rs 9 lakh. Itâ€™s another matter that it took almost a year before Uma Bharati, the sports minister at</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30341;left:16"><nobr>the time, finally handed the cheque to me at a function in Delhi.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30364;left:41"><nobr>The first thing I did with the prize money was to buy a paddy field for Apa. He would no longer be</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30387;left:16"><nobr>a landless farmer in an agricultural society. Our family celebrated with a Thanksgiving feast. I then set</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30411;left:16"><nobr>aside money for the education of my brother and sister. They had been denied a lot to make my dream</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30434;left:16"><nobr>possible and it was only fair that I repay them. The cheque might have been for me, in acknowledge-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30458;left:16"><nobr>ment of my achievements, but my boxing career wasnâ€™t just about me, it was about my whole family.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30481;left:16"><nobr>We were in it together in every way.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30504;left:41"><nobr>And where would I be without the Manipur boxing establishment? I expressed my gratitude to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30528;left:16"><nobr>them when I donated a small sum of money to the MABA. I conveyed my thanks to my coaches, Oja</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30551;left:16"><nobr>Ibomcha, Oja Narjit, Oja Kishan and Oja Khoibi Salam (secretary of the MABA) because it was their</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30575;left:16"><nobr>effort to make Manipuri women world-class boxers that helped me translate my ambition into success.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30598;left:41"><nobr>Oh, and I did buy myself a two-wheeler, although Anu dissuaded me from buying a Pulsar. I settled</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30621;left:16"><nobr>for the more feminine Activa. Women in Manipur drive two-wheelers because it is the easiest way to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30645;left:16"><nobr>commute from one place to another. It gives us independence and saves time.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30668;left:41"><nobr>The rest of the money I set aside for my training and travels. I had to be thrifty and spend only on</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30692;left:16"><nobr>the most urgent needs. My career had only just begun. While my parents no longer needed to spend</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30715;left:16"><nobr>sleepless nights thinking about providing for me, or themselves, even the remarkable sum of Rs 9 lakh</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30738;left:16"><nobr>could not fund every dream I had. I needed more.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30762;left:41"><nobr>That first international medal, a silver, will always mean a lot to me. The fight and all that followed</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30785;left:16"><nobr>are clearly etched in my memory. But deep inside, I was not happy with a silver. As I touched down in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30809;left:16"><nobr>India, I had vowed that the next time I would bring back a gold. I knew I was good enough.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:31348;left:12"><nobr>simple folk. I often wished for someone I could turn to for support and guidance when things got com-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31371;left:12"><nobr>plicated or lonely â€“ personally as well as professionally. I was spending more and more time away from</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31395;left:12"><nobr>home. Very often, I couldnâ€™t return even for Christmas. It was a sacrifice I was willing to make, but it</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31418;left:12"><nobr>did get lonely. My only friends were from the world of boxing.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31442;left:37"><nobr>I had given up my studies for the sport. The only languages I knew were Manipuri and my own Kom</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31465;left:12"><nobr>language. Outside Manipur, I became acutely conscious of my inability to communicate effectively in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31488;left:12"><nobr>either Hindi or English.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31512;left:37"><nobr>It was at such a time that I met Onler Kom, and though I didnâ€™t know it then, it was a meeting that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31535;left:12"><nobr>would change my life completely. I was in Delhi during a training session in 2000 when Onler and a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31559;left:12"><nobr>friend of his came to see me. He was then the president of the Kom-Rem Studentsâ€™ Union in Delhi and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31582;left:12"><nobr>was pursuing a degree in Law. He was responsible for the welfare of Kom students in Delhi, one of the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31605;left:12"><nobr>most popular destinations for students from the Northeast. Onler had been entrusted with the respons-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31629;left:12"><nobr>ibility of looking me up and briefing me about the union and its activities.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31652;left:37"><nobr>I was quite surprised to hear that I had a visitor because I didnâ€™t know anybody in Delhi. We shook</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31676;left:12"><nobr>hands and spoke a little. He was much older than me and I thought of him almost as a concerned, older</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31699;left:12"><nobr>brother. Before he left he told me that I must get in touch with him if I needed any help.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31722;left:37"><nobr>When there was a break in the camp I called Onler to let him know that I was going home. I asked</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31746;left:12"><nobr>him if he wanted anything from Manipur. He was surprised that I had called, and with an offer, not a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31769;left:12"><nobr>request. I had brought back some home-made food and dry fish, and offered to drop some off at the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31793;left:12"><nobr>house he had rented in Munirka. At the time, I was only repaying his gesture of friendship to me in a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31816;left:12"><nobr>strange city where I knew no one.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31839;left:37"><nobr>What really deepened our friendship was his concern over my lost passport when I was in Hisar. He</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31863;left:12"><nobr>followed up on progress back in Manipur and as soon as the passport reached Delhi, set off to deliver it</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31886;left:12"><nobr>to me. I came to regard him truly as an older brother and guardian then.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31910;left:37"><nobr>I began confiding in him and sharing my worries, and explained to him how my parents struggled to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31933;left:12"><nobr>send me Rs 1,000 every month. I told him how they would sometimes neglect my siblingsâ€™ school fees</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31956;left:12"><nobr>to send me the money I needed. My brother and sister had to face the humiliation of standing outside</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:32303;left:16"><nobr>On Sundays, when I had a little free time, Onler and I would meet, and weâ€™d eat a home-cooked meal</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32326;left:16"><nobr>with friends and relatives. It was very de-stressing for me. We shared a language and background,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32350;left:16"><nobr>which helped me relax in Onlerâ€™s company. He followed my career closely and wanted to help me</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32373;left:16"><nobr>reach as far as I could. He only had sage advice and cautionary words for me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32396;left:41"><nobr>Onler was nursing a broken heart those days after the end of a long-term relationship and he told</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32420;left:16"><nobr>me as much frankly. His mother had passed away recently, and Onler often felt like going back home</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32443;left:16"><nobr>to be with his family. But his father had urged him to pursue higher studies, so he had enrolled in the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:32490;left:41"><nobr>Meanwhile, womenâ€™s boxing was becoming a popular sport. In 2003, I received the Arjuna Award,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32513;left:16"><nobr>which was a huge boost for my career. With this, my ratings in the marriage market shot up too. Back</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32537;left:16"><nobr>home, young and old suitors began to approach my parents. In my work sphere too, I began to get a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32560;left:16"><nobr>lot of unwanted attention from admirers. All of this made me restless and uncomfortable. I spoke to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32584;left:16"><nobr>Onler about the situation.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32607;left:41"><nobr>â€˜Mary, why are you getting all these proposals? Are you interested in marriage?â€™ he asked me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32630;left:41"><nobr>I was stuck for an answer. Marriage was not on my agenda; all I wanted to do was to play and win.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:32747;left:16"><nobr>derstood that the â€˜gold medal haulâ€™ (as people were calling it those days) was not easy at all. I had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32771;left:16"><nobr>put everything else in my life aside to spend five or six hours every day working out and keeping fit.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32794;left:16"><nobr>I practised my techniques with single-minded devotion, fought bouts in the ring with different spar-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32818;left:16"><nobr>ring partners, threw punches at bags to perfect myjabs. Then there was the fact that I was constantly</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32841;left:16"><nobr>travelling, getting ready for one championship or the other. The level of competition rose with every</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32864;left:16"><nobr>tournament. I couldnâ€™t afford to be caught off -guard even for the National Championships. Where was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32888;left:16"><nobr>the time for romance?</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32911;left:41"><nobr>I did not realize that Onler was being updated with news from home. He was upset by the fact that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32935;left:16"><nobr>so many proposals were coming in for me. I began to sense a change in his attitude. He was worried</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32958;left:16"><nobr>that my parents would accept a proposal without my consent and force me into a marriage. His imagin-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32981;left:16"><nobr>ation went wild. He even believed that someone might use black magic to charm me. That particular</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33005;left:16"><nobr>fear was rooted in the fact that Koms were believed to be experts in black magic. Before the advent</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33028;left:16"><nobr>of Christianity, using charms and magic was the way of life among our tribe. While we do brush aside</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33052;left:16"><nobr>these stories as just folklore, traces of the old culture linger. Onler felt compelled by his need to protect</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33075;left:16"><nobr>me. A wrong partner would definitely be the end of my career. Since I was young and quite naÃ¯ve, he</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:33155;left:16"><nobr>feared that I would be swayed by the attentions of these suitors. It wasnâ€™t unheard of for sportspeople</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33179;left:16"><nobr>to have romantic affairs.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33202;left:41"><nobr>I was touched by his concern. We had been close for a few years and he understood my tempera-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33225;left:16"><nobr>ment, my whims and fears, my passion for boxing, my need to defend my title. Simply put, he felt he</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33249;left:16"><nobr>knew me best.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33272;left:41"><nobr>What I didnâ€™t realize was that Onlerâ€™s feelings for me had gone through a sudden transformation,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33296;left:16"><nobr>almost like the switching on of a light bulb. He wanted to be more than a friend or an older brother.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33319;left:16"><nobr>Having made up his mind to reveal his feelings for me, he invited Jenny and me to lunch on Sunday.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33342;left:16"><nobr>Jenny is a boxer from Mizoram and a good friend of mine. We were together in most camps. Like any</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33366;left:16"><nobr>other lunch get-together at his place, we cooked our favourite dishes. After a great meal, we chatted</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33389;left:16"><nobr>and joked until it was time for Jenny and me to leave. When I returned to the hostel, Onler called,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33413;left:16"><nobr>which was highly unusual. I wondered if Iâ€™d left something behind.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33436;left:41"><nobr>â€˜Hello?â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33459;left:41"><nobr>â€˜Have you reached the hostel safely?â€™ he asked.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33483;left:41"><nobr>â€˜Yes? Did you have something to say?â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33506;left:41"><nobr>Long pause. â€˜May I say something?â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33530;left:41"><nobr>â€˜Yes, of course, Onler. Do say what you need to.â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33553;left:41"><nobr>Long pause again.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33576;left:41"><nobr>I was beginning to get impatient. â€˜Say it. What is it? I am all ready to listen.â€™ Maybe he wants to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33600;left:16"><nobr>make a declaration of love, I thought to myself, smiling. But I was also beginning to get tired of hold-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33623;left:16"><nobr>ing a silent phone.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33647;left:41"><nobr>Then, mustering all his courage, Onler said, â€˜I think you should understand what Iâ€™m trying to say</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33670;left:16"><nobr>even if I donâ€™t speak the words out loud.â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33693;left:41"><nobr>With that he put the phone down. I was very surprised. When Onler was quiet and hesitant, I knew</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33717;left:16"><nobr>what he wanted to say. I expected him to say the magic words â€“ â€˜I love youâ€™ â€“ or at least something</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33740;left:16"><nobr>to that effect but they never came. I would later joke with Onler that he proposed to me on the phone,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33764;left:16"><nobr>that too without actually saying anything.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33787;left:41"><nobr>But this sudden change in him threw me. Now that I was conscious of his feelings for me, I was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33810;left:16"><nobr>embarrassed about meeting him. I avoided him for a long time. Finally, he rang up Jenny to enquire</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33834;left:16"><nobr>about me and invited us both for lunch. Blissfully ignorant of the tension between Onler and me, Jenny</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33857;left:16"><nobr>accepted. I was reluctant to go but she was so insistent that I had to tag along eventually. I was nervous</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33881;left:16"><nobr>because Iâ€™d be seeing Onler after a long time. I felt my heart beating loudly like a drum and wondered</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33904;left:16"><nobr>whether people could actually hear it. I was mostly quiet through lunch. I no longer felt as free as I did</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33927;left:16"><nobr>before. Once we were done with lunch Jenny and I prepared to leave. Onler whispered to me, â€˜Please</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33951;left:16"><nobr>think about my proposal.â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33974;left:41"><nobr>It certainly did keep me thinking. I played out various scenarios in my head, like I did with my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33998;left:16"><nobr>boxing bouts â€“ the moves, hits, punches, perfect deliveries. I did not doubt Onlerâ€™s affection and care.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34021;left:16"><nobr>He helped me in every way he could. He understood and supported my passion for sports. He knew</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34044;left:16"><nobr>about my humble background and did not put me down for it. Onler understood the world around us</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34068;left:16"><nobr>better than I did. We were from the same community. What more do I need, I asked myself.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34091;left:41"><nobr>Then one day he visited me alone and took me out for a â€˜talkâ€™. Over a cup of tea, he explained</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34115;left:16"><nobr>why he had proposed to me. â€˜I want to protect your career, and that is one of the main reasons for my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34138;left:16"><nobr>proposal,â€™ he declared. I didnâ€™t say anything, and he took that for a yes. â€˜I want to meet your parents.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:34218;left:16"><nobr>Will they accept me? If I go and ask for your hand in marriage, will they agree? If I offer to boil tea</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34242;left:16"><nobr>for them, will your father drink it in acceptance of the proposal?â€™ He said it all so rapidly that it took</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34265;left:16"><nobr>me a while to understand the full import of what he was saying. He was proposing marriage.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34288;left:41"><nobr>For a while I was stumped. Then my mind was racing. A friendship and a relationship I could</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34312;left:16"><nobr>handle, but I didnâ€™t think I was ready for marriage, or to make a lifelong commitment. I was in my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34335;left:16"><nobr>early twenties. My career looked promising. I had a busy schedule of tours and training. It was hard</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34359;left:16"><nobr>for me to think beyond boxing. How would marriage fit into my life?</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34382;left:41"><nobr>On the other hand, in Onler I had found a soulmate who understood my ambition. I did need</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34405;left:16"><nobr>someone by my side to help me and anchor me emotionally. Someone like him. As I thought about it,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34429;left:16"><nobr>my feelings took a complete U-turn. It just happened.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34452;left:41"><nobr>Onler had not taken the trouble to woo me with roses. There were no romantic dinners, long walks</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34476;left:16"><nobr>and chit-chats. He was a straightforward person who laid out the facts, like a boxer delivering punches</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34499;left:16"><nobr>to the face. Perhaps thatâ€™s what won me over. His actions spoke louder than his words. I had to give</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34522;left:16"><nobr>him an answer. Then I had to tell my parents.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34546;left:41"><nobr>If Onlerâ€™s proposal was unromantic, my response was just as prosaic. â€˜Will you let me continue</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34569;left:16"><nobr>playing?â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34593;left:41"><nobr>He took my hand and, holding it, looked into my eyes as he made the promise. â€˜I will never come</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34616;left:16"><nobr>between you and your career.â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34639;left:41"><nobr>Onler called his father to share the news with him. He asked if his dad knew â€˜Mary Kom, the wo-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34663;left:16"><nobr>man boxer from Kangathei.â€™ Onlerâ€™s father said he knew my grandparents, and that Onlerâ€™s mother</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34686;left:16"><nobr>was closely related to my grandfather. We realized then that we shared common roots and fate had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34710;left:16"><nobr>brought us together.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34733;left:41"><nobr>Onlerâ€™s father was against the idea of our relationship. And persuading my parents, I knew, would</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34756;left:16"><nobr>be another matter altogether. I had known Onler since 2001, but my parents had never met him. Our</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34780;left:16"><nobr>courtship was conducted in Delhi.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34803;left:41"><nobr>Knowing my fatherâ€™s temper, I was scared to break the news to him. My career was beginning to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34827;left:16"><nobr>look up and my financial situation had improved. My parents were bound to think that marriage would</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34850;left:16"><nobr>be the end of my ambition. So, even though Onler kept pressuring me to meet my parents, I kept put-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34873;left:16"><nobr>ting it off.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34897;left:41"><nobr>Sure enough, when I finally mustered the courage to tell them, Apa told me stop seeing Onler and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34920;left:16"><nobr>concentrate on my sport without the bother and hindrance of a marriage. I pleaded with him to meet</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34944;left:16"><nobr>Onler before he passed judgement on him.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34967;left:41"><nobr>So far, as the many proposals kept pouring in, Apa had resolutely turned them down. He wanted</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:34990;left:16"><nobr>me to focus on my boxing and to improve my ratings. Naturally, he wasnâ€™t happy with Onlerâ€™s propos-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35014;left:16"><nobr>al either.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35037;left:41"><nobr>Finally, in 2004, Onler and I decided to go to Manipur and face the music. He wanted to meet my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35061;left:16"><nobr>parents first, before his father went to meet them. What if they refuse, I asked him. He paid no heed</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35084;left:16"><nobr>and prepared to meet them by himself. I informed my parents that he would be visiting.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35107;left:41"><nobr>He took a bus from his village to Moirang and walked two-and-a-half kilometres to my house in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35131;left:16"><nobr>Kangathei. He describes it as a long, hot journey. Anu received him at the gate and brought him in.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35154;left:16"><nobr>But Apaâ€™s countenance changed to a â€˜deathly lookâ€™ (as Onler puts it) upon seeing him.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35178;left:41"><nobr>â€˜Who are you?â€™ Apa asked.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35201;left:41"><nobr>â€˜I am Onler, son of Rekhupthang Karong, chief of Samulamlan village.â€™</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:35281;left:41"><nobr>â€˜You â€¦,â€™ my father paused to control his rage, â€˜are you thinking of putting an end to my daughterâ€™s</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35305;left:16"><nobr>career? Why are you disturbing her? Are you showing me disrespect?â€™ My father was not pleased with</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35328;left:16"><nobr>Onlerâ€™s visit and did not bother with playing the gracious host. Without even looking at his visitorâ€™s</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35351;left:16"><nobr>face, he continued, â€˜Donâ€™t follow my daughter around. If you donâ€™t help her, there will be others who</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35375;left:16"><nobr>will. I donâ€™t want you acting smart, trying to convince me.â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35398;left:41"><nobr>I felt sorry for Onler, because my father did not give him a chance to speak. Finally, patiently, he</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35422;left:16"><nobr>explained that he truly loved and cared for me. He wanted to marry me and take care of me, even if it</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35445;left:16"><nobr>meant putting his own career on the line. He had even given up his job in Customs and Excise to be</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35468;left:16"><nobr>near me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35492;left:41"><nobr>Apa was not convinced by all this. As Onler stood up to leave, my father coldly told him not to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35515;left:16"><nobr>send his family over for any negotiations. Anu was very upset with Apaâ€™s behaviour, and so was I. But</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35539;left:16"><nobr>I knew better than to expect anything else of him. Anu and I walked a short distance with Onler, who</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35562;left:16"><nobr>pleaded with her once again to understand his true intentions. He wanted to be by my side, especially</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35585;left:16"><nobr>because I was often travelling by bus or train and it could be unsafe for a young girl. â€˜What if someone</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35609;left:16"><nobr>forcibly abducts her and marries her?â€™ he asked. Anu was supportive and asked him to send his family</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35632;left:16"><nobr>to our house for a â€˜talkâ€™. She promised that she would do her best to convince Apa. Her kind words</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35656;left:16"><nobr>lifted his spirits as he made his way back to his own village.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35679;left:41"><nobr>The traditional manner in which a boyâ€™s family asks for a girlâ€™s hand in marriage is by boiling tea</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35702;left:16"><nobr>in the girlâ€™s house. This is done thrice before the date of the wedding is finalized. The first time On-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35726;left:16"><nobr>lerâ€™s father came, my maternal uncle welcomed him warmly. The first boiling-tea session is usually</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35749;left:16"><nobr>a hush-hush affair, to be done only by two or three members of the boyâ€™s family â€“ usually only the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35773;left:16"><nobr>parents. If the girlâ€™s parents accept the proposal, they drink the tea. When Onlerâ€™s father came to my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35796;left:16"><nobr>house with a few family members, Apa did not even allow them to enter the house.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35819;left:41"><nobr>Apaâ€™s childish behaviour embarrassed and angered me. I left home and went to a friendâ€™s place.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35843;left:16"><nobr>My parents searched all over, but couldnâ€™t find me. They became frantic. Anu even called Onler to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35866;left:16"><nobr>enquire. He was so worried that he borrowed a scooter and rushed to Moirang. Unable to enter my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35890;left:16"><nobr>house, he sent someone to ask if I had returned. By then, I had. He then went back to Imphal, where</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35913;left:16"><nobr>his sister lives.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35936;left:41"><nobr>Early next morning, I packed a few of my things and went to Imphal. I intended to elope with On-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35960;left:16"><nobr>ler. I was still angry and felt let down by my father.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35983;left:41"><nobr>â€˜Letâ€™s get married, with or without my parentsâ€™ approval. And then letâ€™s go to Delhi,â€™ I told Onler.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36007;left:41"><nobr>He calmed me down, and said, â€˜Mary, you are the eldest. You should not act like this. I am also the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36030;left:16"><nobr>last one in my family to get married. We should not disgrace our families.â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36053;left:41"><nobr>By then, my mother had come to take me back home. Anu knew that Onler was in Imphal, so his</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36077;left:16"><nobr>was the first house she went to. Onler assured and reassured me that he would talk to my father again,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36100;left:16"><nobr>and with that to strengthen me I reluctantly followed Anu home. Another day, I made a second attempt</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36124;left:16"><nobr>to convince Onler to leave home, but he firmly refused.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36147;left:41"><nobr>Our family had endured many hardships together so I could follow my passion, and now Apa</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36170;left:16"><nobr>couldnâ€™t understand why I was willing to lose everything just when things were finally looking up. But</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36194;left:16"><nobr>slowly he cooled down and began to see the honour in Onlerâ€™s intentions, and also that he did not take</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36217;left:16"><nobr>advantage of my vulnerability. Knowing my temperament, Apa knew I was unlikely to back down.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36241;left:41"><nobr>When I had calmed down somewhat, I had a heart-to-heart chat with him. â€˜You cannot help me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36264;left:16"><nobr>Donâ€™t you know how difficult it is to get things done without help?â€™</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:36368;left:41"><nobr>Putting the previous episode behind them, Onlerâ€™s family came and boiled tea again in February</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:36414;left:16"><nobr>inent elders of the family. The most important is the third tea-boiling ceremony when there is a big</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36438;left:16"><nobr>gathering of relatives and friends from both families. Onlerâ€™s family brought sweets and delicacies to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36461;left:16"><nobr>the event. This was a public declaration of our engagement. After the ceremony, which was held in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36485;left:16"><nobr>November 2004, the elders fixed a date for our marriage. With that, I was officially betrothed to Onler.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36508;left:41"><nobr>Our community has a custom that requires the groomâ€™s family to pay the bride price that the wo-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36531;left:16"><nobr>manâ€™s family demands. People expected that my father would quote a high price but all he asked for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36555;left:16"><nobr>was the traditional cloth meant for the parents of the bride. Usually, parents of the bride demand a pair</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36578;left:16"><nobr>of bullocks or some money. But my father insisted that all he wanted was for the two families to come</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36602;left:16"><nobr>together in warmth and understanding, and wish for the love and happiness of the two children.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36625;left:41"><nobr>The wedding date was set for 12 March 2005. It was to be my last Christmas with my parents and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36648;left:16"><nobr>siblings. My parents no longer needed to work so hard but being accustomed to labour and toil, they</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36672;left:16"><nobr>kept busy with the farm, kitchen garden and household chores.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36695;left:41"><nobr>My youngest sister was only two years old then. There is an amusing story about the birth of my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36719;left:16"><nobr>sister. Anu was working so hard to provide for my needs that she did not even realize that, after a gap</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36742;left:16"><nobr>of sixteen years, she had conceived again. I was busy those days and seldom went home. I am not</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36765;left:16"><nobr>sure why my parents did not inform me about the pregnancy. When I returned home, I saw Anu with</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36789;left:16"><nobr>a baby. â€˜Am I dreaming?â€™ I asked my father. Getting over my shock, I went up to my mother and the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36812;left:16"><nobr>baby. The moment I held the frail girl in my arms, I fell in love with her. I decided to name her â€˜Cindyâ€™.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36836;left:16"><nobr>She brought luck to the family. Soon after she was born, I started winning national and international</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36859;left:16"><nobr>championships. I became very attached to my youngest sister and would have her stay with me even</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36882;left:16"><nobr>after marriage. Itâ€™s only after my twins came along that she stopped staying with me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36906;left:41"><nobr>My sister and brother were in high school by now, and old enough to understand that I would soon</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36929;left:16"><nobr>be leaving. We spent a beautiful Christmas together â€“ singing, dancing and feasting with friends and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36953;left:16"><nobr>relatives in the village. At home, we sat by the fire, talking, joking, reminiscing and feeling grateful</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36976;left:16"><nobr>for Godâ€™s blessings.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36999;left:41"><nobr>After the festivities were over, preparations for the wedding began in earnest. I had no idea how to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37023;left:16"><nobr>select a wedding dress, because the only fashion I knew was sportswear, track suits and the like. Our</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37046;left:16"><nobr>friends said that wedding gowns were much more reasonably priced in Delhi than in Imphal, so we</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37070;left:16"><nobr>shopped for one there. I settled on a gown that cost Rs 20,000 for the whole set, along with the flowers</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37093;left:16"><nobr>and hand bouquet. I was being extravagant, but I wanted the day to be special.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37116;left:41"><nobr>According to our custom, the wedding ceremony is held in the boyâ€™s house. The modern trend in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37140;left:16"><nobr>Manipur is that a day or two before the wedding, there is a send-off party, or a bridal shower, for the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37163;left:16"><nobr>bride-to-be. I had mine on 11 March in Kangathei. I was supposed to give a farewell speech as part</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37187;left:16"><nobr>of the programme. I dreaded that moment and had to work hard to compose myself. As I started on</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37210;left:16"><nobr>my speech, I realized how painful it was to leave behind everything that had been a part of me for so</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37233;left:16"><nobr>long â€“ the good times and the hard times. I thanked my family for their love and all the sacrifices they</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37257;left:16"><nobr>made for me. Then all the elders spoke, bidding me to be a dutiful wife and a good daughter-in-law,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37280;left:16"><nobr>and bestowing their blessings on me. As the wedding choir sang a farewell song, I cried freely once</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37304;left:16"><nobr>again. We ended the day with a feast.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:37407;left:41"><nobr>My parents had arranged for a few necessary items, like a bed, pots and pans and traditional shawls</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37431;left:16"><nobr>(called saipikhup, ponchai and ponkokhui) to be presented to the groomâ€™s family. I had to take shawls</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37454;left:16"><nobr>and sarongs for everyone in my new family, particularly the elders. On his part, Onler was supposed</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37477;left:16"><nobr>to bring similar gifts for my family. This was meant to signify the growing harmony between the two</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:37524;left:41"><nobr>12 March 2005 dawned fresh and warm, a beautiful spring day. The wedding would take place at</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37548;left:16"><nobr>the Manipur Baptist Convention Church, one of the biggest churches in Imphal. Walking down the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37571;left:16"><nobr>aisle with my father, I was nervous about being watched so closely. I was more comfortable being</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37594;left:16"><nobr>watched in a boxing ring. But at the end of it, Onler was waiting for me, to hold my hands and say â€˜I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37618;left:16"><nobr>doâ€™. We pledged to â€˜love, honour, cherish, to have and to hold in sickness and in health, for richer or</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37641;left:16"><nobr>for poorer, for as long as we both liveâ€™, and exchanged rings to seal our vows. It remains one of the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37665;left:16"><nobr>most beautiful days of my life.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37688;left:41"><nobr>The wedding reception was held at Onlerâ€™s village, sixty kilometres from Imphal. The festivity,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37711;left:16"><nobr>feasting, singing and dancing continued late into the night.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37735;left:41"><nobr>I took a four-month break from boxing so I could ease into my new life. After the wedding we</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37758;left:16"><nobr>stayed at Samulamlan, my new village and home, for about a month. I learnt to adapt to my new fam-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37782;left:16"><nobr>ily and got to know them. Before I left home, the elders in my family had told me to wake up early,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37805;left:16"><nobr>do the household chores, cook and serve my in-laws. I had been worried about whether I would fit</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37828;left:16"><nobr>in and what they would expect of me. My fears were unfounded. Ours was a joint family, comprising</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37852;left:16"><nobr>the two of us, Onlerâ€™s younger brother, Songneireng, his wife Lamneikim, and my father-in-law. My</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37875;left:16"><nobr>sister-in-law wouldnâ€™t let me do anything.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37899;left:41"><nobr>My father-in-law was particularly concerned about my comfort. He woke up very early and would</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37922;left:16"><nobr>call to my husband, â€˜On, get up. Itâ€™s time to help me with some work.â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37945;left:41"><nobr>Onler would taunt me saying, â€˜You are a girl. You should be the one to get up.â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37969;left:41"><nobr>His father, on hearing us bickering, would say, â€˜On, let her sleep. She needs rest. You get up. She</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:37992;left:16"><nobr>is home just for a few days, so let her sleep. Donâ€™t disturb her.â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:38016;left:41"><nobr>I will never forget the love he showered on me. As it turned out, the short time we spent together</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:38039;left:16"><nobr>was one of the last occasions that we would be together as a whole family.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:38062;left:41"><nobr>A month later we returned to Imphal. By then the Government of Manipur had allotted me a house</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:38086;left:16"><nobr>at the National Games Village. The Village had been built for the athletes participating in the 1999</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:38109;left:16"><nobr>National Games and was later turned into government quarters. The earlier occupants of A/112 had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:38133;left:16"><nobr>just vacated, so we had to wait until the house was cleaned and renovated. We stayed in rented accom-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:38156;left:16"><nobr>modation until we could begin our married life in our new house.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:38179;left:41"><nobr>I was glad to be able to set up my home before I had to travel again on work. My mother is a simple</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:38203;left:16"><nobr>woman, with no knowledge of the finer ways of life, but she had taught me how to run a home impec-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:38226;left:16"><nobr>cably. I had even learnt the art of weaving from her.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:38250;left:41"><nobr>Soon enough, it was time to go back to camp and begin training for the Asian Boxing Champion-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:38273;left:16"><nobr>ships and World Championships. True to his word, Onler raised no objections. He dropped me off at</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:38296;left:16"><nobr>the first camp. It was a great feeling to be travelling as husband and wife. I suffered separation pangs,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:38320;left:16"><nobr>of course, but in the years that followed, I left my husband to go from camp to camp.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:38343;left:41"><nobr>Onler knew from the beginning that ours would be an unusual marriage. A wife who is absent for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:38367;left:16"><nobr>most of the year cannot run the home. In our society, the woman runs the house, even if she is a career</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:38390;left:16"><nobr>woman. The kitchen is her domain; she is the one who shops for vegetables and groceries. In fact,</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:40620;left:16"><nobr>It was my willpower that saw me through it all.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:40643;left:41"><nobr>Curiously, the fact that the basic medicines one takes for a cold or cough somehow always show up</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:40690;left:16"><nobr>are, more often than not, unaware of how doping really works. I believe it is the responsibility of our</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:40783;left:41"><nobr>But to return to my Delhi win, it is probably the most memorable for me because I was able to win</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:42001;left:37"><nobr>Manipur has been an insurgency-torn state since the 1980s. With a population of a mere twenty-sev-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42025;left:12"><nobr>en lakh, it is home to over thirty militant groups. They are best known to the outside world by their</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42048;left:12"><nobr>acronyms, most notably NSCN-IM, NSCN-K, UNLF and KNO.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42072;left:37"><nobr>These groups dominate different areas where they run parallel governments, each with its own con-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42095;left:12"><nobr>stitution and vision for the future. People who live in remote villages with no police or army security</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42118;left:12"><nobr>are the most vulnerable. Chiefs of villages are given demand letters, and if they fail to fulfil the milit-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42142;left:12"><nobr>antsâ€™ wishes, they are kidnapped, very often never to return. Sometimes the demand is for supplies, at</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42165;left:12"><nobr>other times that the village should arrange recruits for one or the other organization.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42189;left:37"><nobr>After Christmas Onler and I returned to Imphal on 27 December. As we were relaxing over a cup</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42212;left:12"><nobr>of tea, the phone rang: unknown insurgents had kidnapped my father-in-law. He had just stepped out of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42235;left:12"><nobr>the house to collect coal for the meiphu, a traditional heater thatâ€™s used in every Manipuri home during</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42259;left:12"><nobr>the winters. An eyewitness later told us that some men walked up to him and asked him to follow them</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42282;left:12"><nobr>for a talk. For a while, no one noticed his absence. When the family finally realized he was gone, an</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42306;left:12"><nobr>alarm was raised and the whole village turned up to search for him. Because there was no electricity in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42329;left:12"><nobr>the villages (there still isnâ€™t), it was dark everywhere. The frantic search yielded no results. There was a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42352;left:12"><nobr>forest right next to the village and insurgents found it easy to wreak havoc and escape into it. Later that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42376;left:12"><nobr>night, my father-in-law was found dead some distance away. To this day we do not know who killed</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42399;left:12"><nobr>him. That there was no demand for money or any other kind of intimation from the insurgents made the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42423;left:12"><nobr>whole situation even more painful and frustrating for us.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42446;left:37"><nobr>By the time we reached the village, he had already been found dead. The shock and grief we felt</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42469;left:12"><nobr>then is beyond anything I have the capacity to describe. Onler was devastated. Till then, it had never</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42493;left:12"><nobr>occurred to us that we would ever be directly affected by the political problems of our state. These sorts</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42516;left:12"><nobr>of things always happened to other people. It was a while before the reality, that we were the victims</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42540;left:12"><nobr>of insurgency, actually sunk in. Friends and relatives started pouring in. New Yearâ€™s Day was bleak. It</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42563;left:12"><nobr>remains the most painful chapter in our lives.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42586;left:37"><nobr>At the funeral people came to pay their respects. We were insecure and afraid. Who were the killers?</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42610;left:12"><nobr>Why did they kill him? What did they want? Would they come again? We stayed in the village until</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:42769;left:41"><nobr>Back in Imphal, Onlerâ€™s grief gave way to anger. He wanted revenge. We hardly ate. We couldnâ€™t</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42792;left:16"><nobr>sleep. All we could think about was the killing. Onlerâ€™s refrain was, â€˜I will avenge my fatherâ€™s death,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42816;left:16"><nobr>even if it means joining the insurgency. An eye for an eye. As a man, as a son, I will find the culprits</nobr></div>

<font size="3" face="Times"><span style="font-size:16px;font-family:Times">
<div style="position:absolute;top:44104;left:12"><nobr>while silently grieving on my own. I was so preoccupied that I had no time to think about myself or</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44127;left:12"><nobr>my health. I felt sick and nauseous most of the time. I put it down to the stress we were all facing, but</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44151;left:12"><nobr>Onler, concerned as ever, took me to a doctor. Thatâ€™s how I found out that I was pregnant. We had no</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44174;left:12"><nobr>plans to start a family so soon. I told my mother first. And then I tried to wrap my head around what</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44198;left:12"><nobr>had happened. I had to start caring for my health and stop doing any form of vigorous exercise.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44221;left:37"><nobr>Something snapped in Onlerâ€™s head. He felt all his hair standing up. He felt all his bitterness melting</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44244;left:12"><nobr>away. He felt like a ray of light had penetrated the dark and gloom of his life. Thoughts of revenge were</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44268;left:12"><nobr>replaced by thoughts of his unborn child. His very mind-set changed: revenge would not bring his fath-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44291;left:12"><nobr>er back, and so it was better to forgive and seek divine blessings for his child. The anger was washed</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44315;left:12"><nobr>away by the hope and joy that the news of my pregnancy brought him. The friends who were all set to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44338;left:12"><nobr>aid him in his revenge were dumbfounded by the change they saw.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44361;left:37"><nobr>So magical was the news of my pregnancy that Onler couldnâ€™t help but wonder if we would have</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44385;left:12"><nobr>twins. His father had been one of a pair of twins. The next medical examination was due for when I was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44408;left:12"><nobr>six months pregnant. Meanwhile, everyone commented on the size of my stomach. I would joke, â€˜Donâ€™t</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44432;left:12"><nobr>you know there are two inside?â€™ But we were worried and thought it best to check with the doctor. After</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44455;left:12"><nobr>an ultrasound and medical examination, I went out and whispered to my husband, â€˜Weâ€™re having twins.â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44478;left:12"><nobr>For him, it was like the rebirth of his father. The few dark clouds that still hovered disappeared with</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44502;left:12"><nobr>that news.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44525;left:37"><nobr>Thereâ€™s another odd story here. I love gardening and in my leisure time I would tend to the small</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44549;left:12"><nobr>kitchen garden at the back of my house. A pumpkin plant grew there, spreading out all over the back-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44572;left:12"><nobr>yard. The strange thing was that the plant bore only two identical pumpkins during my pregnancy. Later</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44595;left:12"><nobr>I would think that it was announcing the arrival of my twins.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44619;left:37"><nobr>As the date for the delivery drew nearer, Onler and I grew agitated. Would anything go wrong?</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44642;left:12"><nobr>Would it be a normal delivery? If anything, he was more worried than I was. The last month was very</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44666;left:12"><nobr>tiring for me. With my enormous, heavy stomach, I found it difficult to sleep or lie down.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44689;left:37"><nobr>In my ignorance, I thought that labour pains would be some sort of a stomach ache. Thatâ€™s what I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44712;left:12"><nobr>had gathered from seeing women in the village. So when my water broke, I didnâ€™t realize that I was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44736;left:12"><nobr>already in labour. My back was hurting terribly. I told my husband about it, but he was as ignorant as</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44759;left:12"><nobr>I was. Since it was night time already, he said he would wait until the morning and call my gynaeco-</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:44872;left:16"><nobr>her and so we settled down for the night, still blissfully ignorant of the urgency of the situation. I spent</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44895;left:16"><nobr>a sleepless night. The next morning, Onler called my gynaecologist, who yelled, â€˜Bring her at once!â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44918;left:16"><nobr>We rushed to the nursing home, reaching around 7 a.m. The doctor took my husband aside and told</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44942;left:16"><nobr>him that because the water had broken so many hours ago and because of the fluid loss, I needed to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44965;left:16"><nobr>have a caesarean surgery. She explained that a normal delivery was possible, but that it was safe for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44989;left:16"><nobr>only one child, not two.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45012;left:41"><nobr>I was very worried at the thought of an operation. I wanted to continue boxing after my children</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45035;left:16"><nobr>were born and an operation might put an end to my chances. Even at that moment, my thoughts were</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45059;left:16"><nobr>on boxing. I found myself unable to decide one way or the other. For Onler too, it was a difficult mo-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45082;left:16"><nobr>ment. He had promised me that he would support my sporting career even after the birth of the twins.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45106;left:16"><nobr>What if a caesarean meant that I couldnâ€™t play again? My Olympic dream was still unfulfilled. But our</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45129;left:16"><nobr>aunts and elders who had gathered there were unequivocal in their decision: life was more important</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45152;left:16"><nobr>than sport. With Onlerâ€™s approval, I was prepared for surgery. Dr Purnima performed the operation and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45176;left:16"><nobr>delivered my twins on 5 August 2007. We were parents to two beautiful, identical baby boys. Another</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:45374;left:41"><nobr>I had decided from the very beginning that I would nurse the babies, even if it meant delaying my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45397;left:16"><nobr>return to boxing. For the first year of their lives, my only focus was the care of my boys, feeding them,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45421;left:16"><nobr>bathing and changing them, carrying them. My husband commented that I was the perfect mother, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45444;left:16"><nobr>that he hadnâ€™t expected a boxer to carry a baby so gently, or care for him so expertly. While I glowed</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45467;left:16"><nobr>with all the praise, the work was really tiring me out. So Onler took over the job of changing their</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:45514;left:16"><nobr>follow suit. Onler would feed them both Lactogen. There was no electricity at night, so heâ€™d be grop-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45538;left:16"><nobr>ing for the hot water flask in the dark. In his half-asleep state, he knocked over many a flask. Eventu-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45561;left:16"><nobr>ally, though, the babies would be changed, fed and lulled back to sleep. Onler was an extraordinarily</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45584;left:16"><nobr>graceful night-time parent.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45608;left:41"><nobr>Soon enough, it was time to name the babies. In our community, this is a serious affair, in which the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45631;left:16"><nobr>opinions of our elders and the heads of our families are sought. My father, my eldest brother-in-law,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45655;left:16"><nobr>Paominlen, and other elders got together with us for what turned out to be an exciting, thought-pro-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45678;left:16"><nobr>voking session.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45701;left:41"><nobr>Father came up with the idea of adding â€˜worldâ€™ to their names â€“ â€˜Worldthangâ€™ or â€˜Worldchungâ€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45725;left:16"><nobr>â€“ in honour of my World Championship titles. My parents refer to all World Championship titles as</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45748;left:16"><nobr>â€˜World Cupâ€™ titles. So the word â€˜worldâ€™ is dear to my father. This is not an uncommon practice in my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45772;left:16"><nobr>part of the world. It wasnâ€™t unusual for children in the village to be named after a significant event or</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45795;left:16"><nobr>a prized possession of the family. For instance, I remember this one kid who was named â€˜Cyclethangâ€™</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:45935;left:16"><nobr>my sons, the other elders vetoed my fatherâ€™s idea.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45958;left:41"><nobr>Finally, the elders agreed upon names that were derived from those of the two grandfathers. The</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45981;left:16"><nobr>elder twin was named â€˜Rengchungvarâ€™, derived my father-in-lawâ€™s name, â€˜Rekhupthangâ€™. The young-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46005;left:16"><nobr>er twin was â€˜Khupneivarâ€™, which came my fatherâ€™s name, â€˜Pontinkhupâ€™.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46028;left:41"><nobr>For a year-and-a-half after the delivery, I stayed with my children, slowly getting my health and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46052;left:16"><nobr>strength back, and being the mother that they needed at that age. At some point during this time, Onler</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46075;left:16"><nobr>asked me what I would do when I retired from boxing. I knew the answer right away: â€˜I will teach</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46098;left:16"><nobr>children boxing.â€™ He liked the idea very much. In fact, heâ€™s the one who suggested that I should start</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46122;left:16"><nobr>thinking about setting up an academy to teach the younger generation boxing. The idea stayed with</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46145;left:16"><nobr>me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46169;left:41"><nobr>Coincidentally, during my two-year break, no major international tournaments were held.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46192;left:41"><nobr>By the grace of God, there were no complications after my surgery, and I recovered quickly. In</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46215;left:16"><nobr>fact, quick recovery is one of my strong points. Six months after the delivery, I had started to exercise</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46239;left:16"><nobr>and build up my stamina again. The doctor had advised me to rest for three years, but two were more</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46262;left:16"><nobr>than I could handle. I was ready for a comeback a year after the caesarean operation.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:47316;left:12"><nobr>would lose steam and ambition. When I didnâ€™t, they made hurtful remarks about my in-laws: â€˜Look at</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47340;left:12"><nobr>them. With Mary as their daughter-in-law, their fortune has changed. They are wearing expensive shoes</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47363;left:12"><nobr>and clothes.â€™ Then, when the babies arrived, they said, this is the end. Even my parents felt that my</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:47410;left:12"><nobr>wrong.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47433;left:37"><nobr>In fact, after the children arrived, Apa had said, â€˜Sanahen, now that youâ€™re a mother, itâ€™s enough.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:47527;left:12"><nobr>I got a prize money of Rs 3.5 lakh. In 2005, I got a job that gave me a monthly income and I was given</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47550;left:12"><nobr>a house. Apa believed that all of this was more than enough. I had already bought him a paddy field, my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47574;left:12"><nobr>siblingsâ€™ education was taken care of. I was also taking care of my older brother-in-law Jamesâ€™s four</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:47667;left:12"><nobr>asked. People in the village dread surgery. I told him that I wouldnâ€™t let anyone hit me on the stomach</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47691;left:12"><nobr>and declared vehemently that nobody could stop me from boxing. My fatherâ€™s words added fuel to the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47714;left:12"><nobr>fire. I became more determined than ever.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47738;left:37"><nobr>The person who used to encourage me the most was my father-in-law, but he was not around to tide</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47761;left:12"><nobr>me over this difficult phase. He would playfully say that I should keep boxing for as long as I could</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47784;left:12"><nobr>â€˜jump aboutâ€™. I remember with gratitude that he was supportive when even my own parents thought I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47808;left:12"><nobr>should stop. â€˜Let her play as long as she wants,â€™ he said to my husband.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47831;left:37"><nobr>Iâ€™ve often said that I am not comfortable with delivering speeches. I am most articulate in the boxing</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:48061;left:16"><nobr>er, separation from my children meant that I had to skip feeding them, because of which I developed</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48084;left:16"><nobr>mastitis. The first night away from them, the pain was so intense that I was up all night crying. From</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48107;left:16"><nobr>Delhi, where I had a stopover before travelling to Hisar, I called Onler to tell him about the pain. He</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48131;left:16"><nobr>asked me to consult a doctor immediately. I called on Dr Rosy, whom both of us knew. She prescribed</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48154;left:16"><nobr>a painkiller, which made things a little better.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48178;left:41"><nobr>In spite of the pain, I was determined to resume training. That one month in Hisar was the most</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48201;left:16"><nobr>difficult camp experience I have ever had. On the one hand, I was missing my children like crazy. On</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48224;left:16"><nobr>the other, my body let me down with all these aches and pains. Half the time, I was sick or nauseous,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48248;left:16"><nobr>and only managed to do some of the workouts and a little bit of sparring. The coaches were under-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48271;left:16"><nobr>standing and did not push me too hard. I endured the camp, getting through it one day at a time. More</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48295;left:16"><nobr>than once, I had to beat down the yearning to hang up my gloves and run home.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48318;left:41"><nobr>However, the attitude of the other girls, particularly those from my weight category, pushed me to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48341;left:16"><nobr>stick it out in the camp. None of them said anything snide, but their looks said it all. They seemed to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48365;left:16"><nobr>think my peak performance was behind me, that I was no threat to them anymore. My determination</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48388;left:16"><nobr>saw me through and I was selected for the tournament, which was to be held in Guwahati in September</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48412;left:16"><nobr>2008. I was given the honour of taking the oath on behalf of all the participants. I was a little nervous</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48435;left:16"><nobr>about my comeback, but I also felt centred and positive.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48458;left:41"><nobr>My first fight was the quarter-final bout. When I stepped into the ring, the nervousness fell away.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48482;left:16"><nobr>I got back my rhythm. I was down 0â€“2 in the first round, but in the second, I remained calm and was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48505;left:16"><nobr>able to concentrate. I won the match 8â€“2. It was more than I could have hoped for. I had just come</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48529;left:16"><nobr>back from a two-year break, with only a two-month camp to re-train my body and mind. Godâ€™s bless-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48552;left:16"><nobr>ings, my husbandâ€™s support and the hard work put in by my coaches helped me get there. Onler was in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48575;left:16"><nobr>the gallery to witness and cheer my return. He had left the kids back home with my mother.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48599;left:41"><nobr>I wasnâ€™t too impressed with my performance in the semifinal bout against Nguyen Thi Hoa of Vi-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48622;left:16"><nobr>etnam, but I managed to win the round and qualify for the final, where I had to face Jong Ok of North</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48646;left:16"><nobr>Korea. I had defeated her earlier, in the Third Womenâ€™s World Championships in Russia, but on this</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48669;left:16"><nobr>occasion, I couldnâ€™t. I had to settle for silver.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48692;left:41"><nobr>For Apa, it was proof that his doomsday predictions were coming true. â€˜See, this time you got only</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48716;left:16"><nobr>a silver. Do you want to end your career in disgrace? Do you want people to backbite and criticize</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48739;left:16"><nobr>your performance? You should have stopped when you were at the top.â€™ I was enraged, and told him</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48763;left:16"><nobr>that I was perfectly happy with a silver after a two-year break and very little practice. I could talk to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48786;left:16"><nobr>Apa and explain my decision. To stop the other tongues wagging, I had to better my performance and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48809;left:16"><nobr>prove them wrong. I would show him and everyone else what I was capable of, I resolved.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48833;left:41"><nobr>I took a two-week break and went home. The twins had grown bigger. I couldnâ€™t take my eyes</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48856;left:16"><nobr>off them. I had missed them terribly. But before I had even settled down, it was time to leave again</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48880;left:16"><nobr>â€“ to Vishakhapatnam this time, for training and selection ahead of the Fifth World Championships.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48903;left:16"><nobr>Because I had been so miserable in Hisar, my husband thought it best if I took the twins with me. He</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48926;left:16"><nobr>felt I would be able to concentrate better if the babies were close by. My mother and a baby-sitter ac-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48950;left:16"><nobr>companied me and the kids to the camp. This was quite unusual, and Iâ€™m sure I made quite a comical</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:49124;left:16"><nobr>mates were surprised that I managed to wake up early for the morning training. The girls did come</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49147;left:16"><nobr>by and visit the boys and hold them, but none of them could help in any way, because they were as</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49170;left:16"><nobr>busy as I was with the training schedule. It was draining but the flipside was that I could see them and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49194;left:16"><nobr>hold them. It was in Vishakhapatnam that my sons began to crawl for the first time â€“ a development I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49217;left:16"><nobr>would have missed if I had left them behind. I was very excited. But their newfound mobility brought</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49241;left:16"><nobr>with it its own set of problems. They tried to crawl everywhere, even falling off the bed. Mother still</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49264;left:16"><nobr>says about those days, â€˜Oh! It was so difficult to take care of the twins in the hot weather.â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49287;left:41"><nobr>Through all of this, Onler held fort at home. He was in constant touch with us and missed the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49311;left:16"><nobr>twins, but couldnâ€™t come and join us because of all the things that needed attention at home. Onler</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49334;left:16"><nobr>knew from the very beginning that he had to give up on his studies and career to help me further my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49358;left:16"><nobr>sporting career. With my steady success came a range of problems. He felt that I needed someone to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49381;left:16"><nobr>push me all the time and he wanted to be that someone. Right after our marriage, Onler was involved</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49404;left:16"><nobr>with an NGO, but after the birth of our twins, he had to give that up too. Apart from taking care of the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49428;left:16"><nobr>children, and everything at home, Onler now also handled my career, leaving me free to concentrate</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49451;left:16"><nobr>on my game. In Manipur, men do not do the work of women. Itâ€™s frowned upon. But Onler handled</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49475;left:16"><nobr>everything during my near-constant absence. A man holding a broom or doing household work is la-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49498;left:16"><nobr>belled â€˜henpeckedâ€™ and spoken of disparagingly â€“ but Onler was unaffected. He has always had a core</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49521;left:16"><nobr>of quiet strength in him. I too draw support and strength from it.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:49626;left:16"><nobr>changed in all the years that I had been boxing. I felt that the techniques we used were outdated when</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49649;left:16"><nobr>compared to what I had seen in other countries. We did not even have a dietician to monitor our food</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49673;left:16"><nobr>and fitness.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49696;left:41"><nobr>Fortunately, by this time I had a sponsor, and through them a specialist doctor was assigned to me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49719;left:16"><nobr>She advised me to increase my calcium intake, since I had given birth. Earlier, all I ate was my usual</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49743;left:16"><nobr>food, with fruits, glucose and vitamins. In the village, no one spoke about health and dietary matters,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49766;left:16"><nobr>so I had no idea that I was supposed to eat a certain sort of food and take supplements to recover from</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49790;left:16"><nobr>the effects of childbirth. After I had my twins, even a few bouts would exhaust me. Apart from my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49813;left:16"><nobr>natural resilience, the reason I managed to get back on the right track so quickly was the attention I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49836;left:16"><nobr>got in terms of nutrition, physical health and better training.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49860;left:41"><nobr>I thought it would help to have foreign coaches to keep up with the competition. I had worked with</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:49907;left:16"><nobr>boxers in other countries were learning. But until boxing became an Olympic sport, that would not be</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49930;left:16"><nobr>a priority for my training.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49953;left:41"><nobr>After my defeat in the Asian Championship finals, I worked harder on every aspect of my game. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49977;left:16"><nobr>gave thought to my overall regimen: the right food supplements, rigorous training, and working up the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50000;left:16"><nobr>confidence I needed. I went on to win gold at the Ninth Senior Womenâ€™s National Championships held</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50024;left:16"><nobr>in Agra in November 2008. That was a boost before I headed to my next destination: the Fifth World</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50047;left:16"><nobr>Championships in Ningbo, China, later that month.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:50163;left:41"><nobr>Ningbo was amazing. We stayed right in the middle of the city and were surrounded by shops and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50187;left:16"><nobr>malls. It was the first time I actually had money to shop with. I took Rs 50,000 with me and bought</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50210;left:16"><nobr>many things, even a camcorder for myself. As for the tournament itself, I was feeling fairly confident</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50233;left:16"><nobr>because I was familiar with the players. My opponent in the finals was my old rival, the Romanian,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50257;left:16"><nobr>Steluta Duta. I was not worried initially, but then it occurred to me that I should never take an op-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50280;left:16"><nobr>ponent lightly. So I declined invitations to the guided tours and instead spent my time practising and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50304;left:16"><nobr>exercising. The effort paid off.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50327;left:41"><nobr>In a repeat of the fourth edition of the championship in Delhi, I defeated Steluta Duta 7â€“1 in the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50350;left:16"><nobr>final. It was, as I remember it, a pretty one-sided match. For me, it was a historic fourth gold. I retained</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50374;left:16"><nobr>my title and became the most successful woman boxer in the world.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50397;left:41"><nobr>Womenâ€™s boxing was picking up by then, and the competition was getting tougher. Many countries</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50421;left:16"><nobr>had womenâ€™s boxing teams now and were participating with increasing fervour. In that sense, the fifth</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50444;left:16"><nobr>edition of the championship was significant. But my hard work and willpower helped me overcome</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50467;left:16"><nobr>odds that critics said I could not face. In a country starved for success in international competitions, I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50491;left:16"><nobr>became the most successful athlete.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50514;left:41"><nobr>Of the four gold medals I secured in the World Championships, this was the most precious. It was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50538;left:16"><nobr>distilled from all the sacrifices I had made. Leaving my husband behind was bad enough, but parting</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50561;left:16"><nobr>from the twins was heartbreaking. I missed many milestones of their growing up. I left them for a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50584;left:16"><nobr>camp or a tournament to come back and find them bigger, their faces just a little different. This medal</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50608;left:16"><nobr>was for them.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:50782;left:16"><nobr>cifically, for womenâ€™s boxing. My first gold at a world championship had put me in contention for the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50806;left:16"><nobr>Arjuna Award. But my name had been struck off at the last moment. It had been a personal disappoint-</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:50853;left:16"><nobr>treated at par with other sports.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50876;left:41"><nobr>The award finally came to me on 21 September 2004. My father travelled with me to Delhi to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50899;left:16"><nobr>receive it. I had been provided with a sari and a blazer for the function, and was required to wear a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50923;left:16"><nobr>matching blouse. The hitch was that I had never worn a sari in my life. Fortunately, the friendly staff at</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50946;left:16"><nobr>the Ashoka Hotel helped me. It took us almost half an hour to get it right. They ensured it was pinned</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:50970;left:16"><nobr>up in strategic places so I didnâ€™t trip over it and make a fool of myself. Interestingly, at the Asian</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:51016;left:16"><nobr>knew how to wear a sari and I was the one helping them wrap theirs, gathering what I could remember</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51040;left:16"><nobr>from my Arjuna Award sari-draping experience.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51063;left:41"><nobr>Soon after the Arjuna, in 2005, I was selected for the Padma Shri, the countryâ€™s fourth-highest ci-</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:51343;left:16"><nobr>sport I competed in. I felt so humiliated by that comment that I responded publicly with this question:</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51367;left:16"><nobr>â€˜How many more titles do I have to win for the country to believe I deserve the honour?â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51390;left:41"><nobr>But how could I beat the cricketers? M.S. Dhoni won the award after one World Cup win. The then</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51413;left:16"><nobr>sports minister, M.S. Gill, assured me that I would be given justice. It was a balm that soothed my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51437;left:16"><nobr>anger. Finally it was announced that Vijender Singh, bronze medallist boxer in the Beijing Olympics,</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:51484;left:16"><nobr>award. In a glittering ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhavan on 29 August 2009, I received the award</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51507;left:16"><nobr>from President Pratibha Patil. My appearance on stage was greeted with thunderous applause. It was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51530;left:16"><nobr>a dream-like feeling. The award included a citation and prize money of Rs 7.5 lakh. Sitting in the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51554;left:16"><nobr>Rashtrapati Bhavan with all those renowned sportspeople around me, I felt my spirit and my commit-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51577;left:16"><nobr>ment to my countryâ€™s sporting glory renewed. I dedicated the award to my sons who were still too</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51601;left:16"><nobr>young to understand why their mother kept leaving them and going away. I hoped they would under-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51624;left:16"><nobr>stand one day.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51647;left:41"><nobr>The Khel Ratna paved the way for other things as well. The corporate world started to come for-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51671;left:16"><nobr>ward to sponsor individual sports. Their involvement helped the sport in general, as well as me per-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51694;left:16"><nobr>sonally, because of the increased resources available for equipment and travel, as well as investment</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51718;left:16"><nobr>in new ways of looking at health and training.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51741;left:41"><nobr>There was also the fact that I was not always recognized as Indian in my own country. Because of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51764;left:16"><nobr>our oriental looks, people from the Northeast are often mocked in other parts of India. Weâ€™re called</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51788;left:16"><nobr>Nepalis, or Chinkies, and people call us names like ching-ching chong-chong. In a country where</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51811;left:16"><nobr>people speak all kinds of languages and have varied kinds of looks, why is such treatment meted out</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51835;left:16"><nobr>to us? When I used to say that I am from Manipur, many people didnâ€™t even know where it was. To be</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51858;left:16"><nobr>honest, in Manipur too we refer to people from mainland India as â€˜Mayangsâ€™, or non-Manipuri, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51881;left:16"><nobr>that too makes me sad.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51905;left:41"><nobr>Whether or not I look â€˜Indianâ€™, I am Indian and I represent India, with pride and all my heart.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51928;left:16"><nobr>Often, when I travelled abroad, the Chinese, Korean, Mongolian, Vietnamese or Thai athletes would</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51952;left:16"><nobr>mistake me for one of their own. Each time, I would explain that I was Indian. But you look like us,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51975;left:16"><nobr>not like them, they would say, pointing at my team-mates.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:51998;left:41"><nobr>After so many years of dominating the world championships, I have become a familiar face to box-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:52022;left:16"><nobr>ers from other countries, as well as to people in my own country. I hope the coverage in many leading</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:52045;left:16"><nobr>magazines will open the minds of our people about the Northeast. Sport has always been a uniting</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:52069;left:16"><nobr>force, in India and around the world. It has enabled me to know so much, learn and see so much of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:52092;left:16"><nobr>my country and the world. I am proud when mediapersons from across the world come to Kangathei</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:52115;left:16"><nobr>to trace the story of womenâ€™s boxing. I feel I have played a big part in making that happen.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:52608;left:12"><nobr>backseat for a few years. The most difficult part of this was hearing the occasional news that my sons</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:52631;left:12"><nobr>were unwell, even if it was only a slight fever or a runny nose. My husband would often just not tell</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:52655;left:12"><nobr>me, to keep me from worrying. But someone or the other would mention something, and then I would</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:52678;left:12"><nobr>be mad at Onler for hiding these details about my boysâ€™ well being from me. I tried to reason with him</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:52702;left:12"><nobr>and told him that even if I couldnâ€™t be with them, as their mother, I had a right to know. At least I could</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:52725;left:12"><nobr>pray for them.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:52748;left:37"><nobr>Both of us are hot-tempered, so many of these conversations would end in tiffs. â€˜Donâ€™t call me any</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:52772;left:12"><nobr>more,â€™ I would tell him. Since he cools off quicker than I do, he would say calmly, â€˜If I tell you, you</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:52795;left:12"><nobr>will only think of home and the children, and your game will suffer.â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:52819;left:37"><nobr>The fact is that it was possible for me to go out and focus on my boxing only because of Onler. Many</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:52842;left:12"><nobr>times, we had sponsorship for my husband to accompany me on my travels abroad. However much he</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:52865;left:12"><nobr>was tempted, he would always decline the offer, because the children were too small to be left solely in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:52889;left:12"><nobr>the care of others. He couldnâ€™t bear the thought of the children sleeping separately in a nursery, so they</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:52912;left:12"><nobr>slept with him. Onler complains that for three years after they were born, he didnâ€™t know what a proper</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:52936;left:12"><nobr>nightâ€™s sleep was like.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:52959;left:37"><nobr>The children were often the reason for our petty quarrels. I tend to be stern with them, and they are</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:52982;left:12"><nobr>so naughty and disobedient that I give them a little beating now and then. My husband gets really angry</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53006;left:12"><nobr>when I do that. He is worried that I may forget my own strength and hit them harder than I intend to.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53029;left:12"><nobr>Of course, if he decides to punish them, then I am the one thatâ€™s upset. On the whole, though, the task</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53053;left:12"><nobr>of disciplining our children and teaching them the right values is left to Onler, because I am away most</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53076;left:12"><nobr>of the time. It is a measure of my faith in him that this does not worry me at all.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53099;left:37"><nobr>The greatest challenge I had to confront in my boxing career was the news of my younger sonâ€™s</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53123;left:12"><nobr>illness just before the 2011 Asian Cup in Haikou, China. Rengchungvar (Rengpa) had a cold and a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53146;left:12"><nobr>fever, so Onler was taking him to a reputed paediatrician in Imphal. I suggested that he take Khupneivar</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53170;left:12"><nobr>(Nainai) as well. He didnâ€™t see the point, but for some reason, I insisted. Isnâ€™t it said that the mother has</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53193;left:12"><nobr>a special instinct?</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53216;left:37"><nobr>The doctor prescribed medicines for Rengpaâ€™s cold and fever. But what he revealed about Nainai</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53240;left:12"><nobr>came as a shock: there was something wrong with his heartbeat. Further investigations revealed that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53263;left:12"><nobr>he had a hole in his heart. He was a normal three-year-old boy who had never shown any symptoms</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:53352;left:16"><nobr>of sickness. We were shattered. Onler and I decided to take him to Chandigarh for treatment; we had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53376;left:16"><nobr>friends there, so it would be easier for us. We consulted Dr T. Shyam K. Singh at the Postgraduate</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53399;left:16"><nobr>Institute of Medical Education and Research. Just a few days before the Asia Cup, the doctor told us</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:53493;left:16"><nobr>because the date of the operation had not been finalized.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53516;left:41"><nobr>I went to China with the team, but my heart was heavy. Onler called every day with updates and to</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:53563;left:16"><nobr>fervently, cast my fears aside and focused on the game. I was away from my family during one of our</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53586;left:16"><nobr>most trying times. I had to make the effort pay off. I did â€“ I won the gold. While the team was celeb-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53610;left:16"><nobr>rating, I was itching to be back in Chandigarh.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53633;left:41"><nobr>We reached Delhi late at night. Fortunately, my sponsors, IOS, had arranged for me to travel to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53656;left:16"><nobr>Chandigarh as soon as I set foot in Delhi. I reached just in time to see my son being wheeled into the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53680;left:16"><nobr>operation theatre. He was very happy to see me. I accompanied him as far as the door, and assured</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53703;left:16"><nobr>him that I would wait right outside for him. With a prayer, I let go of his hand. The surgery went on</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53727;left:16"><nobr>for a long time. We sat outside, barely breathing, praying as hard as we could. Finally, the doors of the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:53820;left:41"><nobr>The moment Nainai regained consciousness, he looked for me. I had to be near him round the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:53890;left:16"><nobr>no damage except for a scar. We call it the Spiderman scar. Heâ€™s a normal five-year-old who runs and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53914;left:16"><nobr>jumps around with his brother. At times I have to scold them and tell them to be careful, because they</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53937;left:16"><nobr>donâ€™t realize the implications of going through a major heart surgery.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53961;left:41"><nobr>Soon after we returned home, it was time to travel again. My boys would ask, â€˜One night or two</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53984;left:16"><nobr>nights?â€™ By now they are used to seeing me leave. Of course, I still need to pacify them each time and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:54007;left:16"><nobr>promise to bring back toys of their choice. Sometimes they ask direct questions like, â€˜Mummy, why</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:54031;left:16"><nobr>do you go far away and leave us?â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:54054;left:41"><nobr>My younger son is more attached to me. When I am home, he keeps coming to check on me every</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:54078;left:16"><nobr>now and then to make sure that I am home. Rengpa is more independent. Between the two of them,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:54101;left:16"><nobr>itâ€™s like thereâ€™s a permanent hurricane in the house. They love to draw â€“ on their books, the walls,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:54124;left:16"><nobr>everywhere. Theyâ€™ve just learnt to spell their names, so itâ€™s everywhere, even outside the gates.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:54148;left:41"><nobr>Iâ€™m often asked about my travels and my favourite places. If I were to answer truly, Iâ€™d have to say,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:54171;left:16"><nobr>home â€“ with my children. Thatâ€™s where and when Iâ€™m happiest. Everywhere I go, I like to speak for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:54195;left:16"><nobr>the rights of children. They are our hope for the future and our surest sources of joy today.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:54734;left:12"><nobr>my sixth participation, with a medal to mark each one, a silver in the first and golds thereafter. It had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:54757;left:12"><nobr>been a long journey â€“ ten years long, beginning in Kangathei and going all the way to Bridgetown, Bar-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:54781;left:12"><nobr>bados.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:54804;left:37"><nobr>My weight category, 46 kg, was no longer recognized by the AIBA, and so I would be competing</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:54828;left:12"><nobr>in the 48 kg slot. Although I had started out at 48 kg in the first championship in Pennsylvania, I had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:54851;left:12"><nobr>moved down to 45 kg by the second one, and then gone up to 46 kg for the Second Asian Womenâ€™s</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:54874;left:12"><nobr>Boxing Championships in Hisar in 2003. Until 2008, this was the category I fought in.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:54898;left:37"><nobr>However, I was confident that my experience and the increased training after childbirth would carry</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:54921;left:12"><nobr>me through. Also, it was a lucky thing that many of my opponents were actually 46 kg fighters who had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:54945;left:12"><nobr>to move to a higher category, like I did. So my opponents were more or less the boxers I would have</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:54968;left:12"><nobr>faced in my regular weight category. Of course, in the new category, there were some who were taller</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:54991;left:12"><nobr>and stronger than I, but the difference was not so great that I really felt the strain. My years of training</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55015;left:12"><nobr>and experience stood me in good stead here. Apart from my own natural aggression, the one quality I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55038;left:12"><nobr>have is the ability to think quickly. I look, observe my opponentâ€™s techniques, think and then fight.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55062;left:37"><nobr>Once again, in the final bout, I was up against Steluta Duta, my old rival. Steluta played hard, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55085;left:12"><nobr>ended the first round 4â€“3 ahead. But the second round was all mine. I landed a well-timed hit and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55108;left:12"><nobr>evened out our scores. Steluta didnâ€™t quite recover her pace after that. By the end of that round, I was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55132;left:12"><nobr>leading 9â€“5, and by the end of the third I had reached 12â€“5. I could see the gold now well within my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55155;left:12"><nobr>grasp, so I gave the last round everything I had, winning the bout 16â€“6.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55179;left:37"><nobr>My husband was awake and tracking the scores of the match online until late into the night. I called</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55202;left:12"><nobr>him up to tell him. It was a very emotional conversation. Only he knew what I had gone through to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55225;left:12"><nobr>clinch this medal.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55249;left:37"><nobr>When I returned to Manipur, thousands of people had lined up at the airport complex. Enthusiastic</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55272;left:12"><nobr>crowds spilled out on to the streets as we drove into the city. I was taken in an open jeep straight to the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55296;left:12"><nobr>Khuman Lampak Indoor Stadium, where the chief minister, O. Ibobi Singh, was the chief guest. Several</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55319;left:12"><nobr>other ministers and high-ranking officials also attended the ceremony. The chief minister handed me an</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55342;left:12"><nobr>incentive award of Rs 10 lakh and announced that I had been promoted to Additional Superintendent of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55366;left:12"><nobr>Police. Once again, he proposed that the road leading to the Langol Games Village be renamed â€˜M.C.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55389;left:12"><nobr>Mary Kom Roadâ€™. Nothing has come of this yet.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:55502;left:16"><nobr>portant people in Manipur. I recalled my days of struggle and expressed the desire to set up a boxing</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55525;left:16"><nobr>academy and train students for the future. It was a thought that had stayed with me since I had chil-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55548;left:16"><nobr>dren of my own, and Onler and I had discussed it as something I should do in the future. I thanked</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55572;left:16"><nobr>the government, and particularly the chief minister, for the encouragement. I said I was proud to be</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55595;left:16"><nobr>Manipuri and to represent Manipur. I ended by expressing my gratitude to the people of the state and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55619;left:16"><nobr>to my well-wishers, and with the hope that I could win a gold at the Olympics.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55642;left:41"><nobr>Yes, after all these years of boxing, I finally had a chance to take part in the Olympic Games, the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55665;left:16"><nobr>greatest event in the world of sport. Womenâ€™s boxing had been recognized and was going to be part of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55689;left:16"><nobr>the 2012 Games in London. That was always my dream and now, in a year and some months, I was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55712;left:16"><nobr>going to take part in the Olympics.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55736;left:41"><nobr>The sports minister, M.S. Gill, too sent a note of congratulations, saying, â€˜She has an exceptional</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55759;left:16"><nobr>record. Manipur has great sports talent and Mary Kom is the best.â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55782;left:41"><nobr>It was balm to my soul to hear all that praise. During training and selection camps, I was always</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55806;left:16"><nobr>one of a bunch of players. I had to prove myself over and over, regardless of my track record. There</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55829;left:16"><nobr>were many players in my weight category from Haryana, Manipur, Delhi and other states. During the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55853;left:16"><nobr>trials for every selection there would be tough competition among us. But I would retain focus and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55876;left:16"><nobr>determination until I had my spot.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55899;left:41"><nobr>There is one particular incident I remember when I lost my cool. During the sparring sessions, I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55923;left:16"><nobr>was sometimes made to fight four rounds with different opponents with a 30-second rest in between.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55946;left:16"><nobr>This was something the coaches asked of all players, so they could test our strength and build up our</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55970;left:16"><nobr>stamina. Once, during such a sparring session in Delhi, the small gym was packed with far too many</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:55993;left:16"><nobr>players. I was feeling so hot and tired that I lost my cool and took off my gloves, saying I wouldnâ€™t</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:56016;left:16"><nobr>play anymore. While everyone had to spar, I did sometimes feel that I was marked, made to fight</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:56040;left:16"><nobr>continuously to deliberately tire me. But I fought with a do-or-die attitude. It wasnâ€™t easy to keep me</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:56063;left:16"><nobr>down.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:56087;left:41"><nobr>Someone once said that when Mary boxes, she hits her opponents bop-bop-bop; thatâ€™s exactly what</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:56110;left:16"><nobr>I do. My selections have been purely on the basis of my performances, not because of my previous</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:56133;left:16"><nobr>medals or past glory. Even the Olympic berth, which came my way under controversial circumstances,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:56157;left:16"><nobr>was something I fought for like a tigress.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:56180;left:41"><nobr>Back home, my family and I celebrated joyously. It was sweet success. We offered our thanks to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:56204;left:16"><nobr>God and I prayed for success at the Olympics.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:56860;left:12"><nobr>reflect on the sport of boxing and its administration in our country. I discussed in an earlier chapter the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:56883;left:12"><nobr>politics that plagued the Manipur boxing scenario. The national milieu was no better.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:56907;left:37"><nobr>In the beginning, when womenâ€™s boxing was not yet an established discipline, there was no politick-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:56930;left:12"><nobr>ing. Training camps were held in various parts of India, and coaches from different states attended them,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:56954;left:12"><nobr>wards in tow. The atmosphere was one of camaraderie and solidarity. Juniors would seek the advice of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:56977;left:12"><nobr>seniors, who would gladly help. In those years, everyone was working towards a common goal: to de-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57000;left:12"><nobr>velop womenâ€™s boxing as a respectable sport in India, and to work towards its inclusion in the Olympic</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57024;left:12"><nobr>Games.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57047;left:37"><nobr>In October 2002, ahead of the Antalya World Championships, twenty-five girls were training at the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57071;left:12"><nobr>Nehru Stadium in New Delhi. We were being coached by National Coach Anoop Kumar and his as-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57094;left:12"><nobr>sistant. Anoop sir found no time to work with me. Upset, I took off my gloves and gear and sat in one</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57117;left:12"><nobr>corner. He was forced to come and coax me to train, and even promised me a flight ticket back if I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57141;left:12"><nobr>brought home a gold. Such was the closeness we shared with our coaches in the early days.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57164;left:37"><nobr>I am going to talk about the more difficult aspects of my boxing career now, but before I do that, I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57188;left:12"><nobr>would like to state clearly that none of this impacts the respect and gratitude that I feel for my coaches</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57211;left:12"><nobr>over the years at the many national camps I have attended. Every one of them â€“ Mahavir Singh, Bhas-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57234;left:12"><nobr>kar Bhatt, Hemlata Badwal, Venkateswara Rao, Ajit Kumar Singh, Sagar Dhayal, D. Chandra Lal â€“ has</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57258;left:12"><nobr>contributed to making me the boxer I am today.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57281;left:37"><nobr>Still, there is no gainsaying the fact that, over the last five years or so, there has been a dramatic</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57305;left:12"><nobr>change. One of the measures taken to maximize the impact of training camps is to divide us into groups,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57328;left:12"><nobr>each of which is placed under different coaches. While this is an efficiency measure, in effect it encour-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57351;left:12"><nobr>ages groupism and favouritism among both the students and the coaches. Quite often, when training</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57375;left:12"><nobr>starts, the atmosphere is about as tense as it is at some disputed international border. Needless to say,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57398;left:12"><nobr>this affects the performance of our athletes.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57422;left:37"><nobr>Even back in 2001, when things were much more friendly, there were accusations of nepotism. Oja</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57445;left:12"><nobr>Narjit had accused the IABF of â€˜readymade selectionsâ€™ to the First Asian Womenâ€™s Boxing Champion-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57468;left:12"><nobr>ships to be held in Bangkok. Of the ten girls on his team, seven were selected. He said that the three left</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57492;left:12"><nobr>out were better than those selected. Being a boxer from the Northeast, and particularly from a remote</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:57604;left:16"><nobr>region in Manipur, I was always worried about being dropped from the selections. Because of this, I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57628;left:16"><nobr>never once let my guard down in any sporting event or space.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57651;left:41"><nobr>I am never going to forget the Senior National Womenâ€™s Boxing camp in Jamshedpur in 2009. In</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57674;left:16"><nobr>my quarter-final fight against Pinky Jangra from Haryana, our points tied at 15â€“15 in the 46 kg fly-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57698;left:16"><nobr>weight category. The verdict went in favour of Pinky. Anil Bohidar, senior joint secretary of the IABF,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57721;left:16"><nobr>said the judges had declared Pinky the winner because her technique, defence and style were better. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57745;left:16"><nobr>agree it was a close fight, but their declaration that her technique and style were better broke my heart.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57768;left:16"><nobr>I felt my years of seniority and past performance ought to have weighed in on the judgesâ€™ decision. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57791;left:16"><nobr>registered a protest, and they suspended me for â€˜unsportingâ€™ behaviour. I still hold the view that I lost</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57815;left:16"><nobr>because there was lobbyism at work, or rather that Pinky won the match due to a bias that worked in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57838;left:16"><nobr>her favour.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57862;left:41"><nobr>The decision to suspend me was taken by a nine-judge jury headed by N.S. Kichi, vice-president</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57885;left:16"><nobr>of the IABF. I was not even officially aware of the twenty-two-day suspension. My husband informed</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57908;left:16"><nobr>me after reading reports in the press. I demanded a rematch to prove myself and submitted a petition</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57932;left:16"><nobr>to P.K. Muralidharan Raja, secretary, IABF. After a meeting with him, I decided to apologize for my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57955;left:16"><nobr>unsporting behaviour and the temporary suspension was revoked. I was humiliated and hurt but I de-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57979;left:16"><nobr>cided to bide my time.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58002;left:41"><nobr>That time came in the Twelfth National Championships in 2011 in Bhopal at the Tatya Tope Sta-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58025;left:16"><nobr>dium. I had increased my weight category to 51 kg, the minimum at the Olympics (in 2009, womenâ€™s</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58049;left:16"><nobr>boxing was officially announced as being part of the Games in 2012). In the finals of the National</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58072;left:16"><nobr>Championships, I was to face Pinky, who had defeated Sarita in a close, much talked about bout. Pinky</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58096;left:16"><nobr>won on an individual judgeâ€™s score, as the tally was locked at 34â€“all after four rounds of intense battle.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58119;left:16"><nobr>First round, they were evenly matched at 7 each. In the second round, Sarita took the lead 11â€“10, in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58142;left:16"><nobr>the third round, they each had 9 points. In the final round, Pinky took the lead 8â€“7 and was declared</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:58283;left:41"><nobr>As an aside, after the match, many parents brought their children to me. They asked for my auto-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58306;left:16"><nobr>graph, some touched my feet. My father was shocked. â€˜Maryâ€™ he said, â€˜you are not God. Why are you</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58330;left:16"><nobr>letting them worship you? At least donâ€™t allow them to touch your feet!â€™ I calmed him, saying, â€˜Apa,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58353;left:16"><nobr>donâ€™t bother. They wonâ€™t stop even if I tell them to.â€™ Having never seen it before, he found the gesture</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58376;left:16"><nobr>very strange.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58400;left:41"><nobr>By this time, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) had declared the inclusion of womenâ€™s</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58423;left:16"><nobr>boxing in the 2012 Games. Only three weight categories were included: 51 kg flyweight, 57 to 60</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58447;left:16"><nobr>kg lightweight and 69 to 75 middle weight. The Olympic camp was scheduled to begin at the Netaji</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:58540;left:16"><nobr>Kumar from Haryana â€“ were entrusted with coaching the women boxers. I had spent some of my</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:58667;left:16"><nobr>coaches were pitted against each other â€“ largely because the boxers had started to lobby for teaming</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58691;left:16"><nobr>up with the coach of their choice.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58714;left:41"><nobr>I happened to be placed in Anoop Kumarâ€™s group, while</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58737;left:41"><nobr>Sarita was included in Chandra Lalâ€™s group. Right from the beginning of my days in boxing, Sarita</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58761;left:16"><nobr>and I had been bosomfriends. We shared everything, including conversations about personal and fam-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58784;left:16"><nobr>ily matters. But since the Asian Games 2010 selections, there had been a growing rift between us. (I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58808;left:16"><nobr>will come to this in some detail later, because I know that it has been a matter of speculation among</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58831;left:16"><nobr>viewers and boxers alike.)</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58854;left:41"><nobr>There was talk of a new chief coach being appointed, and rumours were that it would Chandra Lal.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58878;left:16"><nobr>My view, as a senior boxer, was sought on this issue, and I said that a new chief coach just before the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58901;left:16"><nobr>Olympics would destabilize the team. If a new coach had been selected two or three years earlier, ac-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58925;left:16"><nobr>cording to the proper protocol, it would not have been a problem. I met the sports minister and senior</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58948;left:16"><nobr>boxing officials to campaign against the move. The result was that Kumar continued as chief coach.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58971;left:16"><nobr>Meanwhile, I moved on to thinking about a strategy for my training.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58995;left:41"><nobr>My coaches back in Manipur had equipped me with a strong grasp of the basics of boxing. The</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59018;left:16"><nobr>only thing I lacked back at home was strong enough competition to practice against and hone my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59042;left:16"><nobr>skills. This is where training camps and bouts with international players helped â€“ they broadened my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59065;left:16"><nobr>horizon.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59088;left:41"><nobr>While there were talented women boxers from states like Mizoram, Assam, Bengal, Bihar and Ker-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59112;left:16"><nobr>ala, the most talented in terms of tactics and tricks are the Haryana girls. My coaches had only taught</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59135;left:16"><nobr>me the rules of boxing and the right techniques and styles. I had no other tricks up my sleeve. My</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59159;left:16"><nobr>teammates from Manipur and I had been told to be disciplined, avoid injury and respect the rules.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59182;left:16"><nobr>However, as I gained experience, I encountered players who used various tricks and it agitated me. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59205;left:16"><nobr>have always been aggressive in the ring. I would fight back using the same tricks; I am an eye-for-an-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59229;left:16"><nobr>eye kind of girl. One trick was to hold an opponent and throw her, like wrestlers do. Another was to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59252;left:16"><nobr>hit an opponent on the head swiftly while clinging â€“ as her arms are pinned down, she cannot use them</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59276;left:16"><nobr>to attack. In an exhibition bout in a camp in Haryana during my early boxing days, I got injured when</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59299;left:16"><nobr>my opponent suddenly hit me with her head. I got a cut on my left eyelid and needed stitches. But I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59322;left:16"><nobr>wised up to these tricks fairly quickly, giving as good as I got. Iâ€™ve never suffered any major injury in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59346;left:16"><nobr>my career, just minor scratches and bruises.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59369;left:41"><nobr>I donâ€™t like talking about the Indian womenâ€™s boxing scenario in terms of state teams, but that is</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59393;left:16"><nobr>the reality of how things operate on the ground. Even during training, I was often neglected and not</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59416;left:16"><nobr>given enough attention by the coaches. When coaches and other boxing officials favoured their own</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59439;left:16"><nobr>state players, the only way I could fight back was in the ring, and by aiming higher and higher. Thatâ€™s</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59463;left:16"><nobr>why, even with the odds against me, after the shift to the higher weight category, I knew that I would</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59486;left:16"><nobr>fight to the finish for an Olympic berth â€“ and then, for an Olympic gold.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:60049;left:12"><nobr>I found out that womenâ€™s boxing would be a part of the Games in London 2012. I have always felt that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60072;left:12"><nobr>the reason I have done so well is because every time I enter the ring, I tell myself, â€˜I must win. I will</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60096;left:12"><nobr>fight to win.â€™ I take every tournament seriously and aim to win every bout. But in my heart I hoped that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60119;left:12"><nobr>every one of those bouts, those fights, were training me for the Olympics. Even during my two-year</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60143;left:12"><nobr>break, I followed womenâ€™s boxing closely. I kept waiting for news that womenâ€™s boxing would be re-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60166;left:12"><nobr>cognized as an Olympic sport. It had become an obsession. When I heard that womenâ€™s boxing would</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60189;left:12"><nobr>be excluded from the Athens Olympics, my heart sank. In four years, I would be older, less fit perhaps.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60213;left:12"><nobr>And women boxers across the world were disappointed at the short shrift we were given by the Olympic</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60236;left:12"><nobr>Games organizers.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60260;left:37"><nobr>As brand ambassador of the AIBA, my performance was highlighted in the campaign to include</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60283;left:12"><nobr>womenâ€™s boxing in the Olympics. Before the IOC meeting, I had said, â€˜Boxing is my career, my life.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60306;left:12"><nobr>Iâ€™m just hoping that IOC will give us female boxers the perfect answer.â€™ Our prayers and hard work</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60330;left:12"><nobr>paid off. Women boxers would be able to participate in the 2012 Olympics in London. IOC President</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60353;left:12"><nobr>Jacques Rogge said in a press release on 13 August 2009, â€˜AIBA welcomes women to the world of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60377;left:12"><nobr>Olympic boxing following todayâ€™s historic decision by the International Olympic Committee to include</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60400;left:12"><nobr>womenâ€™s boxing from the 2012 Olympic Games in London.â€™ A good share of this credit must go to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60423;left:12"><nobr>AIBA President Ching-Kuo Wu, who worked hard to get women our due ever since he was elected in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60447;left:12"><nobr>2006. As part of his campaign, he had also highlighted my achievements to the IOC.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60470;left:37"><nobr>And so, I was going to fight the battle of my life: to get an Olympic berth. The boxing ring became</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60494;left:12"><nobr>a battlefield. The first hurdle was that my weight category was not included in the Olympics, forcing</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60517;left:12"><nobr>me to increase my weight to 51 kg and gear up to meet bigger and taller opponents.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60540;left:37"><nobr>To this end, participation in the Asian Games 2010 in Guangzhou, China, would be a first step. The</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60564;left:12"><nobr>Asian Games too had included womenâ€™s boxing for the first time, with the weight categories 51 kg, 60</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60587;left:12"><nobr>kg and 75 kg. The IABF was holding trials for the team that would go to China. IABF Secretary-Gen-</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:60634;left:12"><nobr>wanted no special favours and insisted that I would go on the same day as the others.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60657;left:37"><nobr>This was the greatest challenge of my career and I was going to meet it. As were all the women box-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60681;left:12"><nobr>ers. My statemate Sarita, and Haryana boxers Meena Kumari and Pinky Jangra were also eyeing a berth</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60704;left:12"><nobr>in the 51 kg category. With the coaches, whether from Manipur or Haryana, favouring their own boxers,</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:60793;left:16"><nobr>I knew I was alone in my fight. Comments about my eligibility began flying thick and fast: â€˜Mary is</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:60934;left:41"><nobr>For an Olympic berth, I would need to compete against boxers from five weight categories:</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60970;left:41"><nobr>1. Pinweight: 44â€“46 kg</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:60993;left:41"><nobr>2. Lightweight: 46â€“48 kg</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61016;left:41"><nobr>3. Flyweight: 48â€“50 kg</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61040;left:41"><nobr>4. Light Bantamweight: 50â€“52 kg</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61063;left:41"><nobr>5. Bantamweight: 52â€“54 kg</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61099;left:41"><nobr>From within these categories would emerge the players that qualified for the 51 kg Olympic fly-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61123;left:16"><nobr>weight category. Besides my weight, I also needed to up the ante on my power punches. This meant</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61146;left:16"><nobr>extra weight training and extra food intake. I began to think about asking the sports authorities for a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61169;left:16"><nobr>foreign coach.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61193;left:41"><nobr>A selection trial was held for the Asian Games 2010 by the IBF to pick the Indian team. I was up</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61216;left:16"><nobr>against Sarita for the 51-kg slot. The first trial was held in Bhopal, and there were talks that Sarita</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61240;left:16"><nobr>had already been selected. But I have a recording of that match and am pretty confident that it ought</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61263;left:16"><nobr>to have gone in my favour. Later, the decision on the Bhopal match was withheld because the results</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61286;left:16"><nobr>were inconclusive. It was decided that another match would be held, and both Sarita and I agreed to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61310;left:16"><nobr>this. I defeated Sarita in the repeat bout held in Delhi in September, and was selected to go on to the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61333;left:16"><nobr>Asian Games. She accused the IBF general secretary of favouritism in the selection. I was told that she</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61357;left:16"><nobr>said, â€˜Mary Kom will not get any medal in the 51 kg.â€™ But I was unmoved. I have always had a strong</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61380;left:16"><nobr>heart and that helps me cope. Criticism only brings out the fighter in me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61403;left:41"><nobr>I couldnâ€™t win a gold at the 16th Asian Games at Guangzhou, China. I went down fighting to Ch-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61427;left:16"><nobr>inaâ€™s Ren Cancan 11â€“7 in the semi-final. I came back with a bronze. Ren Cancan, 5'6" tall, was the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61450;left:16"><nobr>AIBA title holder in the 51-kg category at the Barbados World Championships. It was an unfamiliar</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61474;left:16"><nobr>weight category and the defeat was not entirely unexpected. But I was very disappointed. I was gun-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61497;left:16"><nobr>ning for gold; I always am. Later, I met Cancan again at the Sixth Asian Womenâ€™s Boxing Champion-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61520;left:16"><nobr>ships in 2012. That time, I beat her.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61544;left:41"><nobr>The rapid progress I made was due to my British coach Charles Atkinson, with whom Iâ€™d been</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61567;left:16"><nobr>training since May 2011. I knew that I needed to be proactive. I approached the Sports Ministry and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61591;left:16"><nobr>requested them to provide me with a foreign coach. The minister, Ajay Maken, met me and approved</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61614;left:16"><nobr>my request. My sponsors, Olympic Gold Quest (OGQ), helped me identify the right coach. Charles is</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61637;left:16"><nobr>a World Boxing Council coach, and was the guiding force behind the rise of Thai male boxers in the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61661;left:16"><nobr>1980s. The only drawback was that he did not have an AIBA three-star certificate, a degree required</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61684;left:16"><nobr>of an official coach at the Olympics.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61708;left:41"><nobr>Charlesâ€™s lessons made a huge difference to my fighting style. We concentrated on punches,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61731;left:16"><nobr>strength, the guard and combinations. The results were there for all to see. My opponents found it hard</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61754;left:16"><nobr>to get through my defence. Charles also gave me tips on how to improve my attack and counterattack</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:62020;left:16"><nobr>manner. To compete in the 51 kg category, I had to be between 48 and 51 kg. In the lower categories,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62043;left:16"><nobr>itâ€™s better to be at the higher end of the weight spectrum because every kilo makes a difference to the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62067;left:16"><nobr>punch. It took me six months to gain about a kilo-and-a-half. This was quite the opposite for Ren Can-</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:62231;left:16"><nobr>ifying event for the historic debut of women boxers at the Olympics. This time, I had to participate in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62254;left:16"><nobr>the 51 kg at the championships and try for a record sixth world title.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62277;left:41"><nobr>I got a bye in the first round, so my first fight was with Ayako Minowa from Japan. She went down</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62301;left:16"><nobr>20â€“9. This was the first time I met her, and it was a very confusing match. Minowa was very strong,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62324;left:16"><nobr>but had no skill or technique. She fought like a bull, only hitting my belly. Had I fought like her, we</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62348;left:16"><nobr>might as well have been fighting on the streets. Instead, I counter-attacked using mostly my left hook,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62371;left:16"><nobr>which confused her. The next match was against Marielle Hanson of Norway, whom I defeated 26â€“16</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62394;left:16"><nobr>to move to the quarter-finals. It was a good bout. She was tall and very accurate with her punches. Her</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62418;left:16"><nobr>technique was neat, allowing me to test all my combination punches without draining me out. Next up</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62441;left:16"><nobr>was Adams, who had lost to Cancan at Barbados to bag a silver. I had defeated Cancan recently, but I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62465;left:16"><nobr>knew that Adams was not one to be taken lightly. I studied her videos intensely to plan my strategy.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62488;left:41"><nobr>On 16 May 2013, I was ready for combat and sent a prayer up to God as I always do. I fought</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62511;left:16"><nobr>fiercely, using all of my experience and knowledge. I conceded a point each in the first and last rounds,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62535;left:16"><nobr>and ultimately lost. Adams won 13â€“11. I was devastated. It had been such a close fight. And this was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62558;left:16"><nobr>the first time ever that I would be going back empty-handed from a World Womenâ€™s Boxing Champi-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62582;left:16"><nobr>onship.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62605;left:41"><nobr>I now waited anxiously for the result of the semi-final between Adams and Russiaâ€™s Elena</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62628;left:16"><nobr>Savelyeva. My ticket to the Olympics depended on their fight. Elena had defeated North Koreaâ€™s Hye</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62652;left:16"><nobr>Kim and Adams had beaten me. The rule was that if Adams won, the girl she had beaten â€“ me â€“ would</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62675;left:16"><nobr>qualify, and if Savelyeva won, Hye Kim would go through.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62699;left:41"><nobr>I have never rooted for an opponent the way I did this time. Luck was with me: Adams defeated</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62722;left:16"><nobr>Savelyeva 11â€“6.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62745;left:41"><nobr>My team-mates were not so lucky. I felt that I had already created history by becoming the first</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62769;left:16"><nobr>Indian woman boxer - and the only one that year - to qualify for the Olympics.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62792;left:41"><nobr>My long-desired Olympic medal was almost within reach, I believed. My disappointment at not</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62816;left:16"><nobr>winning was forgotten in my euphoria at having qualified for the Games.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:62919;left:41"><nobr>Earlier, OGQ had organized a month-long training camp at the Balewadi Sports Complex in Pune</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62943;left:16"><nobr>â€“ a world-class venue. With permission from the Sports Ministry, I trained separately and exclusively</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62966;left:16"><nobr>there. It was a very different experience. In the national training camps, one coach took charge of more</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62989;left:16"><nobr>than twenty girls at a time, whereas in Pune I trained alone with handpicked sparring partners. While</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63013;left:16"><nobr>OGQ organized this, it was done in co-ordination with the IABF and fully funded by the Sports Min-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63036;left:16"><nobr>istry.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63060;left:41"><nobr>I began training exclusively at Balewadi from March 2012 onwards. I enjoyed the focused attention</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63083;left:16"><nobr>I was getting. The weather in Pune was good and the sports complex peaceful. The accommodation</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63106;left:16"><nobr>was comfortable too. The food was good. When I got bored of spicy curries, I cooked simple food</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63130;left:16"><nobr>that was more to my taste. I have a taste for boiled vegetables cooked with a hint of seasoning. My</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63153;left:16"><nobr>very favourite food, in fact, is plain boiled rice with a simple vegetable curry and smoked fish, and hot</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63177;left:16"><nobr>chutney as a side dish. I was required to eat well and my weight was checked as many as seven times a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63200;left:16"><nobr>day. Sadly, after the gruelling exercise and sparring for two or three hours, all the weight I had gained</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63223;left:16"><nobr>seemed to melt away. But all in all, Balewadi was the ideal place to focus on training.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63247;left:41"><nobr>Altogether, four training camps were conducted. My training partners were from Manipur. MABA</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63270;left:16"><nobr>agreed to send local training partners, as Iâ€™d be able to converse with them more easily, given my lan-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63294;left:16"><nobr>guage problems. Oja Kishan also came, with the three boys that Onler and I had selected in Manipur.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63317;left:16"><nobr>We had checked their height and style of boxing. We were looking for one orthodox, one southpaw and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63340;left:16"><nobr>one who was a mix of both. They had to closely resemble my probable opponents in the Olympics and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63364;left:16"><nobr>also had to be disciplined boxers, because I could not risk any injury just before the Games. At the last</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63387;left:16"><nobr>camp my partners came from the junior boys at the Army Sports Institute in Pune. My coach, Charles,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63411;left:16"><nobr>and I went to the institute to select the right partners. Just before the Olympics, training sessions were</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63434;left:16"><nobr>held for four weeks in Pune and two in Liverpool.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63457;left:41"><nobr>Throughout, my association with Charles was very fruitful. While we didnâ€™t speak the same lan-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63481;left:16"><nobr>guage, we did share our faith in Christianity and our passion for boxing. He made me feel secure and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63504;left:16"><nobr>cared for. His main focus was on developing my strength and stamina. Boxing is a game of the eyes</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63528;left:16"><nobr>and feet, but the most important element is stamina. When one has stamina, the hands will automatic-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63551;left:16"><nobr>ally hit. Without stamina, a boxing match is easily lost, no matter the skill level. The training exercises</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63574;left:16"><nobr>at Pune, therefore, were mainly focused on endurance.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63598;left:41"><nobr>I had to run ten rounds of the athletic track, at medium speed to begin with. As my speed increased,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63621;left:16"><nobr>I had to run twelve rounds daily, which took me twenty-five minutes to complete. I would cool</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63645;left:16"><nobr>down and then do stretching exercises, followed by a physiotherapy session, where a physiotherapist</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63668;left:16"><nobr>checked the parts of the body that felt sore and worked on them. I would rest through the day and get</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63691;left:16"><nobr>ready for the sparring sessions in the evening. I paired up with different partners for two hours every</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63715;left:16"><nobr>day. I was keen on practicing feint attack techniques, but my coach wanted me to strengthen my body,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63738;left:16"><nobr>particularly my belly. I also did circuit training, which is very tiring. If I slowed down even a little,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63762;left:16"><nobr>Charles would say, â€˜Come on, Mary, faster.â€™ On the other hand, when I displayed extra aggression</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63785;left:16"><nobr>in the ring, heâ€™d say, â€˜Calm down, calm down.â€™ When I got too aggressive, I would throw punches</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63808;left:16"><nobr>blindly. I needed to stay calm and make the right, calculated moves. Charles was a positive, affirmat-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63832;left:16"><nobr>ive presence in my life in the run-up to the Olympics.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63855;left:41"><nobr>When I had time to myself, I would often think back to the celebrations that marked the one-year</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63879;left:16"><nobr>countdown to the opening ceremony in London. We were assembled at the British High Commission-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63902;left:16"><nobr>erâ€™s residence in New Delhi. An Omega Countdown Clock was to be unveiled by Abhinav Bindra,</nobr></div>

</span></font>
<font size="3" face="Times"><span style="font-size:16px;font-family:Times">
<div style="position:absolute;top:65364;left:12"><nobr>thought of nothing else. Yet I did not fully know what to expect. I called my husband and sons. Onler, as</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65387;left:12"><nobr>always, spoke words of encouragement and assurance. My sons demanded to know where I was, then</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65411;left:12"><nobr>commanded me to come back soon with lots of goodies. I closed my eyes and prayed. As the plane took</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65434;left:12"><nobr>off, I thought of Rengpa and Nainai. Deep in my heart I knew what the best gift for them would be, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65458;left:12"><nobr>resolved once again that I would do all I could to bring it home. They might not understand what it was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65481;left:12"><nobr>all about but one day, when they grew up, they would. And they would understand why their mother</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65504;left:12"><nobr>was missing in action so often in their childhood years.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65528;left:37"><nobr>At Heathrow, I felt as if I were a matador facing an angry, rampaging bull. There were posters ad-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65551;left:12"><nobr>vertising the Games everywhere, and I could feel my stomach fluttering with excitement and anticipa-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65575;left:12"><nobr>tion.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65598;left:37"><nobr>Charles was waiting for me in Liverpool. It was a relief to see his familiar face. We had planned</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65621;left:12"><nobr>on reaching early so that I could acclimatize to the British climate. While I was training, the local kids</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65645;left:12"><nobr>would often come to watch me. I felt buoyed by their excitement. I stayed at a Kirby Park B&amp;B, run by</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65668;left:12"><nobr>Sharron and her husband, a hospitable, affectionate couple. The home-like atmosphere was much more</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65692;left:12"><nobr>to my liking than a hotel.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65715;left:37"><nobr>We practiced at a boxing gym Charles was familiar with. He had arranged for sparring partners for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65738;left:12"><nobr>me from the gym. By this stage, I needed to be comfortable sparring with anyone at all. My intense</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65762;left:12"><nobr>training was not only physical. I also mentally calculated my moves according to the opponents I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65785;left:12"><nobr>thought I would meet.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65809;left:37"><nobr>Charles himself had come to be a father figure to me. While his technique and skills have improved</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65832;left:12"><nobr>me as a boxer tremendously, it is his love that I will always carry in my heart. I am fortunate to have</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65855;left:12"><nobr>been able to train under him.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65879;left:37"><nobr>The days before the Olympics were devoted to training and rest. Media persons were not allowed to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65902;left:12"><nobr>meet me. Even calls from my family were restricted to keep me free from stress and worry. I spent time</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65926;left:12"><nobr>in prayer and meditation. I told myself often: â€˜If God is for us, who can be against us?â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65949;left:37"><nobr>My physiotherapist, Dr Nikhil Latey, head of the OGQ sports medicine team, was with me</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65972;left:12"><nobr>throughout. He lifted my morale by many notches when he told me that I recovered faster from injuries</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65996;left:12"><nobr>than any athlete heâ€™d come across.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:66108;left:41"><nobr>A few days before the womenâ€™s boxing events were to begin, I moved to the Olympic Games Vil-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66132;left:16"><nobr>lage to stay with the rest of the Indian contingent. The womenâ€™s boxing bouts were to be held towards</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66155;left:16"><nobr>the end of the Games. I tried to relax and preserve my energy, and practiced a little by myself in the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66178;left:16"><nobr>morning and evening. The one thing I most wished for those days was for Charlesâ€™s presence but he</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66202;left:16"><nobr>was not allowed to stay in the Village. The chief coach of the womenâ€™s boxing team, Anoop Kumar,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66225;left:16"><nobr>was with me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66249;left:41"><nobr>I had joined my team at the Village quite late. The other players were already busy with their own</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66272;left:16"><nobr>matches and practices. I would meet the Indian athletes in the dining hall and we would greet each</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66295;left:16"><nobr>other. I know Gagan Narang and Vijay Kumar a little better than the others, as they are also OGQ-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66319;left:16"><nobr>sponsored athletes and Iâ€™ve had more opportunities to interact with them. I also took out time to talk</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66342;left:16"><nobr>to Devendro Singh, who is also Manipuri and a talented young boxer. When he lost, I counselled him,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66366;left:16"><nobr>â€˜A game is a game. One wins and one loses. You are young and you have a promising career ahead of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66389;left:16"><nobr>you. Donâ€™t be disheartened.â€™ Of course, itâ€™s easier to give such advice than take it.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66412;left:41"><nobr>As part of my preparation for the Games, I had to keep checking my weight. Whenever my weight</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66436;left:16"><nobr>went down, I needed to eat more. This was easier said than done, because the food was too sweet for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66459;left:16"><nobr>my liking. I ate a very heavy breakfast, because I preferred that menu to lunch or dinner.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66483;left:41"><nobr>A day before my first bout, my husband and mother arrived in London, leaving the twins in the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66506;left:16"><nobr>care of Sempi, Onlerâ€™s sister, and other relatives. Although their hotel was quite some distance from</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66529;left:16"><nobr>the Village, I managed to meet them. The very sight of them set my spirit soaring. Their presence did</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66553;left:16"><nobr>wonders for my confidence as I prepared for my first fight the following day. I was ready for action.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66576;left:41"><nobr>Before my first bout, I called father to say, â€˜Apa, please pray for me. I have to play today.â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66600;left:41"><nobr>He assured me, â€˜Donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™m always praying for you. Sanahen, I am confident you will not</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66623;left:16"><nobr>come back emptyhanded. May God bless you abundantly.â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66646;left:41"><nobr>My first bout on 5 August was against Karolina Michalczuk of Poland. It was a special day for me</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66670;left:16"><nobr>â€“ the birthday of my twins. It was an auspicious day for my inaugural entry to the Olympics. I was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66693;left:16"><nobr>convinced that nothing would go wrong. So I quelled my nervousness at the vastness of the stage â€“</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66717;left:16"><nobr>this was the Olympics, after all. I regained my composure and asked myself why I needed to be afraid.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66740;left:16"><nobr>My opponents, like me, would have two hands, two feet and two eyes. As before every other bout, I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66763;left:16"><nobr>repeated my magic mantra: â€˜I must win this bout, I must win, I must win.â€™ With that silent prayer, I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66787;left:16"><nobr>turned to my opponent.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66810;left:41"><nobr>She turned out to be very strong. It was like hitting a concrete wall. Caught unawares, at one point,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66834;left:16"><nobr>I lost my footing and fell. But she lacked technique. I used skill and tactics, and drew upon my experi-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66857;left:16"><nobr>ence of facing such strong but raw boxers to counter her attacks. I flung hooks at her head and emptied</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66880;left:16"><nobr>every bit of reserve stamina I had, but won the bout decisively: 19â€“4. I declared to the Indian media</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:66927;left:41"><nobr>I was overwhelmed by the support of my fans. During the bouts, I could hear my supporters shout-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66951;left:16"><nobr>ing, â€˜Mary Kom, Mary Komâ€™. It really set my adrenalin flowing. In the crowd, I could see Bijoy Koi-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:66974;left:16"><nobr>jam Sir and Dileep Sir, who had come all the way from Manipur. I felt indebted to the European Ma-</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:67044;left:41"><nobr>My second bout, on 6 August, against Maroua Rahali of Tunisia, was relatively easier. I started off</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67068;left:16"><nobr>on the defensive in the first two rounds but won them all the same. In the third round, I bounced back,</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:67171;left:41"><nobr>Iâ€™m sure Rahali was taken aback at the sudden change in pace. I won the bout 15â€“6.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67195;left:41"><nobr>I had reached the semi-finals. Not only was I a step closer to the finals, I was also now assured of a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67218;left:16"><nobr>medal. If nothing else, I would return home with a bronze medal. Yes, I wanted gold. But at least, like</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67241;left:16"><nobr>my father had predicted, I wouldnâ€™t return empty-handed.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67265;left:41"><nobr>With only a day of rest, I was up against Adams on 8 August. Remember that it was Adams who</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67288;left:16"><nobr>had beaten me in the qualifiers. She was bigger and stronger than me, having worked her way down</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67312;left:16"><nobr>from a higher weight category to fight in the 51kg class.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67335;left:41"><nobr>I was wearing red, she, blue. I had played against her and knew that she had the advantage of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67358;left:16"><nobr>height. Her reach was much better than mine. Being the shorter, smaller boxer, I did most of the at-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67382;left:16"><nobr>tacking but try as I might, I could not get close enough to hit. Mentally, I was in good spirits and not</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67405;left:16"><nobr>afraid to face her. But physically, I wasnâ€™t in my best form. The first bout against Karolina had taken a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67429;left:16"><nobr>toll on me. My body felt tight and stiff. My movements and my feet were slower than usual. I fought</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67452;left:16"><nobr>desperately, but she won 11â€“6. I was devastated but I also knew that I couldnâ€™t have tried harder, that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67475;left:16"><nobr>I had left no stone unturned. I had given it my best. As far as I was concerned, I had been honest with</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67499;left:16"><nobr>myself. I couldnâ€™t have done more.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67522;left:41"><nobr>As I left the hall, the spectators gave me a standing ovation. I was humbled and moved; I left know-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67546;left:16"><nobr>ing that I would always remember these three bouts. But the curtains had come down on my Olympic</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67569;left:16"><nobr>run.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67592;left:41"><nobr>The moment I stepped out of the stadium, I was surrounded by journalists who started shooting</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67616;left:16"><nobr>questions faster than any blows Iâ€™d parried. At the best of times, I am media-shy. I had stayed away in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67639;left:16"><nobr>Liverpool until my event came up, so I could avoid unwanted attention and keep calm. And now, my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67663;left:16"><nobr>heart was heavy and my dreams shattered. I found it difficult to say anything. During a video confer-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67686;left:16"><nobr>ence with Prakash Padukone and Geet Sethi, live on TV, I was overcome with sorrow and remorse. â€˜I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67709;left:16"><nobr>am sorry I could not win gold,â€™ I told them, but also my countrymen and women.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67733;left:41"><nobr>I really was sorry. After all the effort that had been expended on me, I felt I owed the country more</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67756;left:16"><nobr>than a bronze.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67780;left:41"><nobr>I called my father and broke down on the phone. He was quiet for a while, then said, â€˜Look, my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67803;left:16"><nobr>daughter, the gold is not your birthright. God gave you what you deserve. I am very happy you got an</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67826;left:16"><nobr>Olympic medal. Donâ€™t be discouraged. There will be other times. Be thankful for what you got.â€™</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67850;left:41"><nobr>My coach, Charles, seconded that. His words too meant a lot to me. He told the media later, â€˜Iâ€™ve</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67873;left:16"><nobr>watched that match several times, and I can honestly say that Mary was the better fighter. Adams</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67897;left:16"><nobr>won because she fought defensively and did not pick a physical fight. Mary played the eventual gold</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67920;left:16"><nobr>medallist and didnâ€™t get a scratch on her.â€™ This was balm to my soul.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67943;left:41"><nobr>Standing on the podium for the medal ceremony, my heart was burning, almost bursting with pain.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67967;left:16"><nobr>How I yearned for the gold and for the Indian national anthem to be played. I tried to smile for all the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67990;left:16"><nobr>world to see, but couldnâ€™t help feeling that I had let down my country. But again I consoled myself</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:68014;left:16"><nobr>thinking that I would try again the next time.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:68037;left:41"><nobr>The fact is that it took me days to realize that I was now an Olympic medallist â€“ every sportsper-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:68060;left:16"><nobr>sonâ€™s dream. Suddenly, it felt like all the media attention was on me. It was more than I had expected</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:68084;left:16"><nobr>or imagined possible.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:68107;left:41"><nobr>After the Olympics, the EMA and its general secretary, Somorendro Khangembam, had organized</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:68131;left:16"><nobr>a special meet at a London pub. Many Manipuris came to meet and greet me, and congratulate me for</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:69639;left:12"><nobr>den, I found myself surrounded by guards who ushered me along without saying where they were tak-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69663;left:12"><nobr>ing me. And where were Onler and mother? No one would answer me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69686;left:37"><nobr>Then I stepped outside the airport and understood. A huge crowd welcomed me with bands playing</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69710;left:12"><nobr>music and everyone trying to garland me. It was a rousing, overwhelming, emotional welcome. I tried</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69733;left:12"><nobr>looking for my family but the IABF had organized a vehicle into which I was quickly guided, and we</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69756;left:12"><nobr>started to leave the airport terminal. We were slowed down by the media, who wanted to interview me,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69780;left:12"><nobr>and so managed to only inch forward.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69803;left:37"><nobr>By the time we had done a hundred metres or so, I was frantic. I wanted desperately to see my chil-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69827;left:12"><nobr>dren, who had come to the airport. I felt lost and alone in that crowd. I put my foot down and threatened</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69850;left:12"><nobr>to jump off the moving vehicle if they didnâ€™t let me meet my family. Only then did the vehicle turn</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69873;left:12"><nobr>around and take me back to the airport. There, I found some Kom students who helped me locate my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69897;left:12"><nobr>children and family. My sons saw me and ran up, beaming. I hugged them â€“ at that moment, I didnâ€™t</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69920;left:12"><nobr>care about anything else.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69944;left:37"><nobr>Seeing that this was their chance, the girls and boys who had helped me find my family earlier,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69967;left:12"><nobr>welcomed me with drums and gongs and our traditional dance. I happily joined in. It felt like a proper</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69990;left:12"><nobr>homecoming. My family and I then left for Ashoka Hotel, where the Sports Ministry had arranged for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:70014;left:12"><nobr>us to stay.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:70037;left:37"><nobr>With the request that the media allow me a few hours break, I finally rested for a while. The next</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:70084;left:12"><nobr>I finally left for Imphal after about four days in Delhi.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:70107;left:37"><nobr>Devendro and I travelled to Imphal on the same flight. When we landed, we found ourselves greeted</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:70131;left:12"><nobr>by a massive crowd. The sounds of drums filled the air. In the arrivals lounge, I was welcomed with a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:70154;left:12"><nobr>traditional sarong and shawl. There was a flower-bedecked open jeep outside for the victory ride across</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:70178;left:12"><nobr>Imphal town. The near-constant rain and drizzle did nothing to dampen the spirits of those gathered. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:70201;left:12"><nobr>heard shouts of â€˜Long live Mary Komâ€™ and â€˜Long live Devendroâ€™, and saw garlands and flowers being</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:70224;left:12"><nobr>tossed in the air toward us. Once again, a reception had been organized at Khuman Lampak Sports</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:71836;left:12"><nobr>were all wonderful. I grew particularly fond of Gagan, who treats me like an elder sister.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:71882;left:12"><nobr>celebrities had organized in Mumbai, I was asked to walk the ramp. Also part of the show were industri-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:71906;left:12"><nobr>alists and various film personalities. In the green room, I was dressed in a pink designer outfit designed</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:71929;left:12"><nobr>by Manish Malhotra. I was terribly nervous, of course, but as soon as I walked on stage, the audience</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:71953;left:12"><nobr>stood up to applaud me â€“ it was as if they knew I was nervous and could do with the help. I felt very</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:71976;left:12"><nobr>pretty in that gorgeous dress, like someone out of a fairy-tale. I let go of my inhibitions and enjoyed</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:71999;left:12"><nobr>myself. The crowd went wild.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72023;left:37"><nobr>Posing for photo shoots, cutting ribbons, accepting prizes and awards â€“ those I could do. But when</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72046;left:12"><nobr>it came to attending talk shows and giving speeches, I got nervous and tongue-tied. I still am that way.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72070;left:12"><nobr>Except for a fortunate few, sportspeople tend to be uncomfortable with public speaking. I joked and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72093;left:12"><nobr>shared my experiences with others who were even worse off than me; it was good to know that I wasnâ€™t</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72116;left:12"><nobr>alone. Gagan, I noticed, always has a slip of paper in his hand. Among the Olympians, Vijay Kumar</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72140;left:12"><nobr>seems to be the only one quite at ease with public speaking. The rest say they feel awkward when asked</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72163;left:12"><nobr>to make public speeches.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72187;left:37"><nobr>One of the more challenging and heartening aspects of my new profile was giving motivational talks</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72210;left:12"><nobr>to students. They asked me many questions about my early life, how I balanced my professional and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72233;left:12"><nobr>personal lives and, naturally, about boxing. In one school, the students asked me to sing for them. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72257;left:12"><nobr>obliged with a Hindi song. It was heartening for me to see a few students from Manipur everywhere</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72280;left:12"><nobr>I went. I was glad that youngsters from my remote state were out in other cities and getting the best</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72304;left:12"><nobr>education our country has to offer, getting the opportunities they wouldnâ€™t get in Manipur.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72327;left:37"><nobr>The other new experience in my life was doing photo shoots. I had always imagined that a shoot</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72350;left:12"><nobr>would take barely a few minutes. How innocent I was. It took a whole day for me to shoot for an ad-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72374;left:12"><nobr>vertisement in Mumbai. Putting on makeup, changing clothes, the shoot itself â€“ I had no idea there was</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:72510;left:16"><nobr>good after such a long make-up session.â€™ But I think he was pleased by the transformation.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72533;left:41"><nobr>My favourite photo shoot was for the one with the caption â€˜Our Kom-mitment to the Nationâ€™. The</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72556;left:16"><nobr>billboards seem to be in every nook and corner of Imphal and elsewhere in the Northeast. Every time I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72580;left:16"><nobr>see it, I am reminded of how far Iâ€™ve come, and how far we can all come if we will something strongly</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72603;left:16"><nobr>enough and work hard enough.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72627;left:41"><nobr>I am not choosy about my commercial endorsements, but I decline offers that would spoil my im-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72650;left:16"><nobr>age or promote something I am uncomfortable with, even if they offer more money. On the other hand,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72673;left:16"><nobr>there are projects I am willing to take on that have nothing to do with the money. I was particularly</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72697;left:16"><nobr>happy to be the brand ambassador for the Super Fight League.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72720;left:41"><nobr>The travel that accompanied all this glamour was tiring. There were times when I was in two cities</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72744;left:16"><nobr>on the same day to fulfil commitments. Home seemed more distant than ever. I donâ€™t know how I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72767;left:16"><nobr>would have managed if Onler had not been by my side. That he was there made the travel as pleasant</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72790;left:16"><nobr>as it could be.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72814;left:41"><nobr>The most difficult part of all this is that I am not home enough. My friends say, â€˜Mary, you must be</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72837;left:16"><nobr>tired. You and your family should go on a holiday.â€™ My favourite holiday destination is quite simply</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72861;left:16"><nobr>my home. Itâ€™s humble and messy, but thereâ€™s no place Iâ€™d rather be.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72884;left:41"><nobr>The moment I step into the house, I shed the sports celebrity skin and take over the running of the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72907;left:16"><nobr>house â€“ usually with the children clinging to me, because they donâ€™t see me enough. I do try to be back</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72931;left:16"><nobr>as often as I can. Sometimes I come back even if itâ€™s only for a day or two, rather than rest elsewhere.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72954;left:16"><nobr>As soon as Iâ€™m back, I check if everythingâ€™s in order with the kids: their clothes, books, shoes, toys</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:72978;left:16"><nobr>and so on.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73001;left:41"><nobr>I then move on to putting my house in order. I clean the compound, backyard and every nook and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73024;left:16"><nobr>corner with the help of the nephews, nieces and cousins who are staying with me just then. I rearrange</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73048;left:16"><nobr>things around the house, and only then do I sit back and relax. Not for long though, because my hus-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73071;left:16"><nobr>band and children have been waiting for me to come home and cook for them. I enjoy cooking and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73095;left:16"><nobr>Iâ€™ve been told that Iâ€™m good at it. I often cook for the students of the Academy; they compliment me</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73118;left:16"><nobr>by finishing every last grain of rice there is. Needless to say, I cook all the dishes I missed while I was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73141;left:16"><nobr>away. For me, the choicest five-star food does not compare to simple home-cooked meals.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73165;left:41"><nobr>For Onler, the best part of my presence at home probably is that he can catch up on his sleep. He</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73188;left:16"><nobr>has more time to spare and to catch up with work and deadlines. He is happy and relaxed when Iâ€™m</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73212;left:16"><nobr>around. For one, I take the children off his hands. Ironing their clothes, sticking labels on their books,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73235;left:16"><nobr>helping with their homework â€“ in the little time I have with my boys, I want to do it all.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73258;left:41"><nobr>I love doing the simple things in life. Gardening, for instance. I spend my free time planting veget-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73282;left:16"><nobr>ables in the backyard. I love to see the plants grow. One morning, I woke up to find that our two dogs</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73305;left:16"><nobr>had made a complete mess of a sapling. I was furious. I made a tight fence around the garden so they</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73329;left:16"><nobr>couldnâ€™t get to it.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73352;left:41"><nobr>My professional life spills over into the home as well, of course. Many journalists and photograph-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73375;left:16"><nobr>ers visit me. Often I am in the middle of washing clothes or dishes, or cooking a special dish for the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73399;left:16"><nobr>family, when they come. I have to keep them waiting, because I cannot leave things half done. At such</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73422;left:16"><nobr>times, Onler meets them and talks to them, giving me time to wrap things up. He helps me with my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73446;left:16"><nobr>speeches and with the things I want to say.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:73549;left:41"><nobr>My extended family lives with me, including my brother-in-lawâ€™s four children. Their father,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73573;left:16"><nobr>James, nicknamed James Bond by the family, was a football player in his youth. Jamesâ€™s son,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73596;left:16"><nobr>Oneithang, is one of the most promising boxers at the Academy. My niece Tonijoy is heaven-sent. She</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73619;left:16"><nobr>has been caring for my twins with so much love that it has to be seen. My sister-in-law, Sempi, who</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73643;left:16"><nobr>lives nearby, also chips in with looking after the twins. Needless to say, my mother is deeply involved</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73666;left:16"><nobr>with the care of her grandchildren. Raising my sons has been a joint family endeavour.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73690;left:41"><nobr>It is a comforting thought that I can leave my children in safe hands when I am away. But in the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73713;left:16"><nobr>midst of my photo shoots and felicitation ceremonies, I can never put my worries completely at rest.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73736;left:16"><nobr>Onler is not adept at housekeeping and the others are too young to run a house well. I am fortunate</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73760;left:16"><nobr>that my relatives all come by and keep things in working order. But for them, the boxing gloves would</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73783;left:16"><nobr>be hanging somewhere, gathering dust. When the celebrations have wound up and the fame is gone, I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73807;left:16"><nobr>know I have my family to come home to.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73830;left:41"><nobr>I suspect that Onler may want me to come home sooner rather than later. After the Olympics, at</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73853;left:16"><nobr>the felicitation function organized by the Kom-Rem Fellowship in Imphal, I spoke about my desire</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73877;left:16"><nobr>to work hard for the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games in 2016. Onler said, only half in jest, that itâ€™s</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73900;left:16"><nobr>extremely hard to raise two young boys and manage a home without a wife, and so I should consider</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73924;left:16"><nobr>hanging up my gloves. We are yet to negotiate that.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73947;left:41"><nobr>Meanwhile, it is a matter of pride and joy to me that Anu and Apa are finally in a good place in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73970;left:16"><nobr>their lives. They continue to stay in Kangathei, because they like living in the village with friends and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73994;left:16"><nobr>relatives around. Iâ€™ve asked them but they donâ€™t want to shift to town. Their house has been trans-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74017;left:16"><nobr>formed, though, with the rooms they have added to it. They now use cooking gas in the kitchen. A</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74041;left:16"><nobr>two-wheel tractor has replaced the bullocks. The granary is filled with rice for a year. My sister is mar-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74064;left:16"><nobr>ried and now has a daughter. She lives in Kohima, Nagaland and keeps a lovely home. My brother too</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74087;left:16"><nobr>is married and our parents will soon be doting grandparents to more children. Apa and Anu are happy</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74111;left:16"><nobr>and contented.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74134;left:41"><nobr>I know for a fact that fame hasnâ€™t changed me very much. I am still shy in public, yet aggressive in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74158;left:16"><nobr>the ring. I am as short-tempered as I always was, and just as loving. My life still revolves around my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74181;left:16"><nobr>family and boxing. Whatâ€™s changed is that I can now afford luxuries: I own a house (more than one</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74204;left:16"><nobr>actually, thanks to two corporate gifts), two cars and I travel by air when I need to. I used to dream</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74228;left:16"><nobr>about a BMW but now that I can afford one, I think itâ€™s too expensive and the roads in my hometown</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74251;left:16"><nobr>are not ideal for such expensive cars.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74275;left:41"><nobr>I was also able to finally fulfil the promise I made to Anu. In December 2012, I handed over the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74298;left:16"><nobr>keys of a Bolero to my father. While Anu touched it shyly, Apa checked every part of the car as if he</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74321;left:16"><nobr>were an expert mechanic. He sat behind the wheel promptly, although he doesnâ€™t know how to drive.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74345;left:16"><nobr>He looked so tiny behind the wheel that I said, â€˜Apa, it will look better if Anu drives and you sit next</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74368;left:16"><nobr>to her.â€™ Everyone burst out laughing. Eventually, we had to hire a driver to take the vehicle home. As</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74392;left:16"><nobr>they sat in the car, laughing and joking, my heart filled with their joy at the gift. Every time Anu looks</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74415;left:16"><nobr>at the Bolero, he will know that our years of struggle were not in vain.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74438;left:41"><nobr>If I havenâ€™t changed after all the success Iâ€™ve had, neither have my parents. They are still the simple</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74462;left:16"><nobr>village folk who farm for a living. Only, Apa has become an expert at speaking to the media. He does</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74485;left:16"><nobr>most of the talking, seeking Anuâ€™s help only when heâ€™s confused about some event in my life.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74509;left:41"><nobr>Filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali is actually making a movie based on my life. Blue Lotus Pro-</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:74612;left:16"><nobr>they were interested in my story and that it would make for a good movie. I met them in Imphal with</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74636;left:16"><nobr>Onler, Jimmy and a couple of other friends and advisors, and we all felt comfortable working with</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74659;left:16"><nobr>each other. I would never have thought anything about my life was so interesting, but I hope that it is</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74682;left:16"><nobr>a source of inspiration to children across India. Iâ€™m pleased, of course, that someone as beautiful and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74706;left:16"><nobr>talented as Priyanka Chopra should be playing me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74729;left:41"><nobr>Just when things quietened down a little, I was nominated for the Padma Bhushan. For once, I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74753;left:16"><nobr>didnâ€™t think I deserved it, because I managed to get only a bronze. The silver medallists, Vijay Kumar</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74776;left:16"><nobr>and Sushil Kumar, deserved it more. It was deeply humbling, and filled me with renewed energy and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74799;left:16"><nobr>passion to do more for my country and my sport.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74823;left:41"><nobr>The aftermath of fame hasnâ€™t always been easy to handle. There is a general opinion that I rake in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74846;left:16"><nobr>millions, and I cope with that every day I am home. I get countless requests for donations for all sorts</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74870;left:16"><nobr>of causes. Some of these are good causes that I know to be genuine. Others, I have no way of finding</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74893;left:16"><nobr>out. And I certainly do not have the wherewithal to accede to every request I get. I have also read too</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74916;left:16"><nobr>many stories of famous sportspeople dying in penury to spend incautiously right now. I wasnâ€™t born</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74940;left:16"><nobr>with a silver spoon in my mouth. Itâ€™s hard for me to believe that all of this will last.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74963;left:41"><nobr>But I do want to give back to sport and society, and I do that through the M.C. Mary Kom Boxing</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74987;left:16"><nobr>Academy. I also want to be a champion of hope for the women of my country. I want them to look at</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:75010;left:16"><nobr>me and see their image in me. I want them to believe that if I can make it, so can they.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:75994;left:12"><nobr>I faced for that stance. For a large part of my career, I had no sponsors. I have even, on occasion, paid</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76017;left:12"><nobr>for my travel to participate in competitions and camps. I have proven that women can achieve as much</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76041;left:12"><nobr>as men can, and I have shown that boxing can be as engrossing as cricket for Indians. Today, there is a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76064;left:12"><nobr>marked improvement in facilities for other sports. I hope that my academy will prove to be another step</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76088;left:12"><nobr>towards bringing boxing out of the sidelines, and providing both boys and girls with the encouragement</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:76181;left:12"><nobr>port or resources. Many youths in the far-flung villages of my state drop out of school and then, with no</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76205;left:12"><nobr>means to earn a livelihood, join the insurgency. Others marry early and end up with a big family, con-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76228;left:12"><nobr>tinuing the cycle of poverty. Yet others, with no one to guide them, resort to drugs as a means to escape</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76251;left:12"><nobr>reality. I hope the Academy will channel the energy and frustration of at least some of those youths to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76275;left:12"><nobr>the noble art of boxing.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76298;left:37"><nobr>I established the Academy in my backyard with very few resources in 2006, with a clear vision:</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76322;left:12"><nobr>quality boxers with potential from the underprivileged class. When we began, we had no proper infra-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76345;left:12"><nobr>structure, or even a boxing ring. All I was armed with was talent, experience and the support of my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76368;left:12"><nobr>husband. To date, we function without a permanent address or a proper hostel for the students. But now</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76392;left:12"><nobr>that land has finally been allocated, I am hopeful that we will have a roof over our heads sometime in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76415;left:12"><nobr>the not-so-distant future.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76439;left:37"><nobr>The idea for a boxing academy was born on a trip to Mokokching village for a function in 2005.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76462;left:12"><nobr>There, I happened to meet my sister-in-lawâ€™s younger sister, Nengneihat. When I saw her, it struck me</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76485;left:12"><nobr>that she could have potential as a boxer â€“ her height, build, boyish appearance, all of it appealed to me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76509;left:12"><nobr>She was an orphan, staying with her relatives. I sought the permission of her elders, brought her home</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76532;left:12"><nobr>with me and began to teach her the basics of boxing. She was the first of my extended family to join</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76556;left:12"><nobr>us; the number gradually increased over the years. Nengneihat was a fast learner, and soon became my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76579;left:12"><nobr>sparring partner at home during my daily practice.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76602;left:37"><nobr>When the news spread that I was teaching a student, many parents started bringing their children</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76626;left:12"><nobr>to me, with a request that I teach them boxing. Unable to refuse, I began to teach a few of them. The</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76649;left:12"><nobr>number of students gradually increased. Then Onler came up with the idea of a boxing academy. I was</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:76808;left:16"><nobr>boxers, and it would allow me to take in more students too. When I thought about it in that light, the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76832;left:16"><nobr>idea appealed to me greatly.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76855;left:41"><nobr>Although I did not possess a coaching diploma, I felt that my years of training and experience</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76879;left:16"><nobr>would suffice for teaching students the basics of boxing.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76902;left:41"><nobr>So, in addition to the students whose parents brought them to me, I scouted for youngsters from</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76925;left:16"><nobr>poor families who appeared to have potential. Some of my boys and girls are as young as ten, but</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76949;left:16"><nobr>most are in their teens. The expenses â€“ food, lodging, an extra coach, a warden for the students â€“ came</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76972;left:16"><nobr>from my pocket. Most months, it was my entire pay packet. My efforts paid off when my first student,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76996;left:16"><nobr>Nengneihat, began to win medals. In 2008, she won gold at the All India Inter-SAI, followed by silver</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77019;left:16"><nobr>the next year. At the national level, she managed to get a silver and bronze, and at the state level, she</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77042;left:16"><nobr>won two golds.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77066;left:41"><nobr>Only after my students started getting medals did the Academy come to be recognized. Ten of our</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77089;left:16"><nobr>boxers have been referred to the SAI centre in Khuman Lampak. T.S. Merina Chiru won a gold at the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77113;left:16"><nobr>Second National Womenâ€™s Sub-Junior Boxing Championships in 2011. K. Oneithang Kom is another</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77136;left:16"><nobr>promising boxer, who has won gold at the state level, followed by a silver. OGQ is sponsoring Neng-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77159;left:16"><nobr>neihat and Oneithang as medal potentials, which in itself is a great achievement for the Academy.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77183;left:41"><nobr>In 2010, the academy was renamed â€˜M.C. Mary Kom Regional Boxing Foundationâ€™ after it was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77206;left:16"><nobr>upgraded to a regional academy â€“ that is, it is now officially recognized and is meant to cater to all</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77230;left:16"><nobr>of the Northeast. But we are still functioning without proper facilities and infrastructure. The workout</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77253;left:16"><nobr>and sparring is done in the open every morning and afternoon. Onler and I worry about this, because</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77276;left:16"><nobr>our training must necessarily stop during the monsoons. There are no rings, no proper rooms to house</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77300;left:16"><nobr>the equipment and a rented house serves as hostel for the students. I make arrangements for the boys</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77323;left:16"><nobr>and girls to live separately. Some of the students also stay in my house when the rented accommoda-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77347;left:16"><nobr>tion is not enough, until such time that we can arrange a place for them to stay. Most of them are from</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77370;left:16"><nobr>far-off villages, so accommodation is a big issue for us.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77393;left:41"><nobr>Slowly, things are falling into place. The army â€“ which has a very lively culture of boxing â€“ has</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77417;left:16"><nobr>been actively supporting my academy with donations of a generator, boxing gear, gymnasium and even</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77440;left:16"><nobr>kitchen equipment. As I was writing this book, the allotment of the two-acre land, which Chief Min-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77464;left:16"><nobr>ister O. Ibobi Singh promised me, has come through. Under the SAI extension scheme, SAI Manipur</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77487;left:16"><nobr>has been providing sports kits and a stipend of Rs 600 per month for my students since August 2010.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77510;left:41"><nobr>The student strength keeps fluctuating. Some students drop out because of health reasons, others</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77534;left:16"><nobr>are asked to leave. It is of utmost importance that a sportsperson should be disciplined, obedient and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77557;left:16"><nobr>hard-working. As of mid-2013, there are thirty-four students, of whom ten are not boarders.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77581;left:41"><nobr>The students are like members of my extended family. In addition to sports training, I spend time</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77604;left:16"><nobr>exhorting them to work hard. I tell them about my life, and hope that it will inspire them. â€˜Look at me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77627;left:16"><nobr>I am a nobody who became a sporting icon only because of my consistent hard work,â€™ I say. I teach</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77651;left:16"><nobr>them to be modest, but to aim big. I donâ€™t hesitate to point out their mistakes and correct them. I am a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77674;left:16"><nobr>very strict teacher when Iâ€™m coaching. But Iâ€™m an equally affectionate mentor. I often tell them, â€˜You</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77698;left:16"><nobr>are fortunate to have a world champion as your cook.â€™</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:77801;left:41"><nobr>When I look at these kids, I think back on my own life. I hope that boxing opens their minds and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77825;left:16"><nobr>hearts as it did mine. Over these years, I have made close friends, of whom Jenny is the one I am most</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77848;left:16"><nobr>in touch with. The girls and I spent a lot of time together, doing non-work things, especially when</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77871;left:16"><nobr>we went abroad. We would go out shopping. We snacked at various food stalls and tasted all sorts of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77895;left:16"><nobr>foods. In India, during the off days in our training camps, we went out to watch movies. Abroad, we</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77918;left:16"><nobr>were taken sight-seeing, which was always fun in a group. I really enjoyed my visit to Rome. The city</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77942;left:16"><nobr>was beautiful and the churches divine; Iâ€™d gladly visit it again â€“ this time with my family. Through my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77965;left:16"><nobr>travels across India and my interaction with boxers from across the country, I learnt about the different</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77988;left:16"><nobr>cultures of India and what it means to be truly Indian. All of this and more I wish for the youngsters at</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:78012;left:16"><nobr>my academy.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:78035;left:41"><nobr>The official coach of the Academy is S. Naobi Singh from Sekta, Imphal. I join him to teach stu-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:78059;left:16"><nobr>dents the finer tactics of sparring. Onler fills in to guide students on their exercises whenever he can</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:78082;left:16"><nobr>spare the time. Nengneihat is a sort of monitor for the rest, because she is the most experienced of the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:78105;left:16"><nobr>lot.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:78129;left:41"><nobr>It is my dream to make this an international-standard boxing academy with excellent facilities. It</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:78152;left:16"><nobr>will be a place where children can train and study free of cost and bring in medals for the country. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:78176;left:16"><nobr>hope that sometime in the future we will be able to extend our facilities to include education, so that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:78199;left:16"><nobr>there is all-round development of the sportspeople we train.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:78222;left:41"><nobr>Violent crimes against women are on the rise in India â€“ a phenomenon that I have been observing</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:78246;left:16"><nobr>with alarm. I have been considering adapting my training in boxing to self-defence courses. Perhaps I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:78269;left:16"><nobr>can provide such courses for women, and not just in Manipur, in the future.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:78293;left:41"><nobr>A country like India has a lot of potential. I end with the hope that we will build on that. My life is</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:79075;left:12"><nobr>and tiredness could so easily have been due to the crazy schedule I was keeping. It was only in mid-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79098;left:12"><nobr>November 2012, when I was travelling by road, that I felt particularly out of sorts. I began to suspect</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79122;left:12"><nobr>that I needed a medical checkup. Once I got home, I arranged for this immediately and the results came</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79145;left:12"><nobr>back positive for pregnancy. I was three months pregnant, I learnt.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79169;left:37"><nobr>This time too, I had no plans for a baby. But I took the news gladly, accepting it as yet another</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79192;left:12"><nobr>blessing from God. I cut down on my commitments and took much-needed rest at home. By then, I had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79215;left:12"><nobr>begun work on my autobiography. One of the reasons youâ€™re holding this book in your hands is that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79239;left:12"><nobr>my pregnancy forced a break in my normal schedule, giving me time to think and reflect on the past, to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79262;left:12"><nobr>look forward to the future.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79286;left:37"><nobr>My third child was born on 13 May 2013. Once again, it was a C-section. The doctors said that the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79309;left:12"><nobr>baby would be big and that a normal delivery would be risky. I was hoping for a daughter after my two</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79332;left:12"><nobr>boys. But the child was a boy. The healthy baby boy â€“ 3.8 kg at birth â€“ was cause for huge celebrations</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79356;left:12"><nobr>at home. My sons were delighted to have a baby brother and took turns holding him. We were worried</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79379;left:12"><nobr>that they would smother the newborn with their hugs and kisses.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79403;left:37"><nobr>This time, my husband had already decided that my grandmother â€“ Chungthem, the eldest in our</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79426;left:12"><nobr>family, and almost a hundred years old now â€“ would name him. She had also named me. Onler felt that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79449;left:12"><nobr>it would be an honour to have a son named by her. She came up with a few names, but finally decided</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79473;left:12"><nobr>on Chungthanglen, which means height, fame and largeness, because he was born at the height of my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79496;left:12"><nobr>sporting glory. The name Grandmother bestowed on him also called down a blessing on him: that he be</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79520;left:12"><nobr>endowed with fame, attain great heights and become a large-hearted, good person.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79543;left:37"><nobr>Not satisfied with one name, I wanted a nickname for him. My sons wanted â€˜Prince Sonâ€™, and I op-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79566;left:12"><nobr>ted for Prince, since both the families are descendants of chiefs.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79590;left:37"><nobr>Chungthanglen Prince â€“ my third son â€“ is an added joy to the family. As I watch him grow, I am</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79613;left:12"><nobr>also waiting for the months to pass, so I can start my fitness exercises and pick up my boxing gloves.</nobr></div>
