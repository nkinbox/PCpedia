	<h2 class="font-primary color-primary">My Story</h2>
	<p>In my second semester, I became so fond of web-design that it lead me to self learning some computer languages.
	By the End of Third semester my expertize in software development drove me to a company where I designed a few harmful applications and earned some money.
	There I learned about cold calls and when i digged into it i found <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2014/12/18/microsoft-takes-action-tech-support-scammers" target="_blank" class="text-muted">this</a> blog post from Microsoft.</p>
	<p>I started pcpedia in the hope of declining the graph of these fraud businesses.
		I want to create a community that will help beginners in understanding personal computers and troubleshooting basic problems themselves
		rather than relying on support from other sources.</p>
	<h2 class="font-primary color-primary">Pastime</h2>
	<p>when i am not working, instead of learning IUPAC names of chemicals, i tend to spend my time sketching.</p>
	<p>I occasionally contribute to stackoverflow community.</p>
